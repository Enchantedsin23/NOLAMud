Toffee-brown tresses spill in framing waves around a heart-shaped face ruled by symmetry, a wispy fringe of fine locks falling wimsically across her brow. Low-lit hints of smoldering mahogany follow its silky length to the subtle flare of svelte hips, the scent of lavender drifting languidly through each strand. Almond-shaped jade-green eyes, long-lashed and delicately-browed, rest above high cheekbones, flanking a straight, button nose. Her soft mouth tends toward mirth, touched with the hint of a smile when at rest, the slim curve of her upper lip offsetting the plump bow of her lower. Deep dimples nestle in the smooth skin at their corners, a small, rounded chin lending to her visage an air of stubbornness.
Her smooth complexion, peaches and cream over porcelain, speaks to a strictly European ancestry. An inch or so taller than the average female, her body is supported by lithe musculature; Her slimly-toned torso is sensually curved, her limbs lissome and long. She moves with effortless grace, each motion performed with a perfectly controlled purpose. While gentle in mannerisms and word, she bears herself with a quiet, ready confidence.
