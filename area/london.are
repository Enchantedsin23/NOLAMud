E
statue~
The Physical Energy statue, installed in 1907, is by George Frederick
Watts, who claimed the statue was "a symbol of that restless physical
impulse to seek the still unachieved in the domain of material things". 
This was particularly appropriate for Cecil Rhodes, made his fortune before
he was 30 and in 1880 established the De Beers mining company, which has
dominated the diamond industry ever since.

Lobby at Cheval Three Quays~
This old apartment building isn't in great shape.  It's not in ill
repair, its just been weathered by time.  The furniture is faded and the
wood of the counter is marred and scratched from use.  The brass of the
hanging chandelier is tarnished, but the old bones of the building seem
solid and it feels warm and inviting.  On the western wall are a series
mailboxes for the residents.

The Aspley Gate at Hyde Park~
The grand entrance to Hyde Park has a bold projection: the moss-limned
entablature is supported by four handsome, fluted columns; the volutes of
the capitals of the outside column on each side of the gateway present two
complete faces to view.  Three carriage archways cut by reddish brick roads
flank and center the gate with footpaths to the right and left; both paths
present insulated columns.  The entrance is finished by an iron blocking,
and the sides of the central carriageway are decorated with a beautiful,
Elgin marble frieze depicting a naval and military triumphal.  The gate is
of iron, bronzed, and fixed or hung to the piers by rings of gun-metal.  The
design consists of a beautiful arrangement of the Greek honeysuckle
ornament; the parts being well defined, and the raffles of the leaves
brought out in an extraordinary manner.  A grand lawn to the west houses a
fantastical 18th century manor; snow-white walls and gothic turrets ring the
exterior.

Wellington Arch at Hyde Park~
Reddish brick fades into well-worn cobblestone as carriage and footpaths
converge into a single walkway.  The arch forms a corresponding entrance
from the Aspley Gate to Serpentine Road.  A single opening lifts four times
the height of a man through the center of the arch.  The entabulature is
lofty with a richly sculptured frieze and a row of boldly projecting lions'
heads on the cymatium; the lions mark the centers of the columns.  Above the
entablature is raised an attic, the body of which is embellished with a
sculptural representation of an ancient triumph.  On each of the columns is
a statue of a warrior, and on the summit of the acroterium which surmounts
the attic rests a winged, black iron figure in a quadriga.  Grassy lawns
stretch out, hedging the walkway and arch.  To the west a cobbled path leads
toward a Regency-style ironwork bandstand.  East, an unassuming sign labels
a blend of lawns and pavement as Speakers' Corner.

Serpentine Road at Hyde Park~
Dutch Elm trees stand like rows of sentinel soldiers on both sides of the
Serpentine Road; a flawlessly smooth path of wide, gray concrete scattered
with almond-shaped leaves.  Shallow slopes of lawn are visible here and
there, some separated from the road by stout iron wrought fences, some
openly exposed.  Well-worn dirt paths weave serpentine veins through the
grass to the sweeping, pendulous branches of weeping beech trees.  Runners
make daily use of the road that weaves its curve from monument to monument;
north, concrete smoothly curves toward the Long Water lake.  To the south
the richly sculptured Wellington Arch is raised above the walkway.  East the
trumpet-like opening of the Rose Garden ducks beneath a trellis arch.

Rotten Row at Hyde Park~
The heavy branches of paperback maples and holm oaks crowd the edges of
the bridleway, in constant danger of growing together; a vague canopy is
formed with breaks of sky in the middle.  During the day patches of light
fall on the sand-covered brick below.  The low iron bollards that hedge the
broad road peter off to the north, trailing heavy rungs of chain into
thickets of foliage.  To the south the bridleway continues; the trees darken
and thicken, and shadows are more prevalent even during the brightest hours
of day.  On a low concrete post a round plaque cast in bronze faces the
bridleway, just out of view in the brush.  To the east a side-path through
the trees broadens and rises toward Dell Bridge.

Serpentine Road at Hyde Park~
The grassy berm to the right of the Serpentine is cleaved by a clean
curve of magenta snapdragons, lighter in front, blending back into darker
shades of taller flowers.  A tangle of tall licorice stalks and wild
oriental poppies fade back further still, leading up to the base of the
Queen Caroline Memorial; a stone urn mounted on a plinth overlooking the
east end of Serpentine Road.  Behind it the picturesque lake created at her
request is divided from the plinth by a loose patch of daffodils.  To the
left of the road concrete slopes down into the Long Water; the lake, an
immensely long, curving kidney, follows the gradual turn of the road.

The Long Water at Hyde Park~
Across the placid surface of the lake the branches of weeping birch and
wingnut trees tangle into a singular ridge of green.  The wide, smooth gray
concrete of Serpentine Road reflects the lake's steady curve; to the right
shallow slopes of grass carpet the spaces between Dutch Elm trees,
occasionally set with benches and stone picnic tables.  To the left the
concrete forms a descending berm into the lake, allowing open access to the
water.  Iron guardrails follow the downward slope into the lake every so
often to accommodate swimmers' escape.  Rare patches of tall reeds cluster
along the far bank, providing sanctuary for ducks.  White patio umbrellas
populate the concrete outside the Lido Bar and Cafe to the east, arching
above circular tables.

The Rose Garden at Hyde Park~
Designed from the concept of horns sounding at one's arrival to the park,
the Rose Garden is a central, circular area enclosed by a tall yew hedge;
imagined to be the mouth of a trumpet, and the seasonal flower beds the
flaring notes pouring out of the horn.  The circular hub is enclosed by a
rose arbor with pillars and chains.  Roses are mixed with herbaceous
planting, creating rich seasonal flower beds and pervasively strong scents. 
The spectacular blooms attract high numbers of tourists in summer, retaining
popularity throughout the year as a quiet, contemplative place for locals. 
A grand pergola and two fountains -- the Boy and Dolphin and Diana the
Huntress -- are entrapped in paved walkways.  Pebbled stone paths lead under
arched lattice tunnels that wind to and fro, thickly laden under tangles of
foliage; Serpentine Road opens westward through one of them.

Lido Bar and Cafe patio at Hyde Park~
With its stupendous position overlooking the Serpentine in London's most
famous park, right next to the Long Water and the Diana Memorial Fountain,
the Lido Bar and Cafe could serve mud and leaves washed down with a cup of
mildew and still attract customers.  The large alfresco dining area is
scattered with white patio umbrellas; each umbrella shields the circular
table beneath it from both sunlight and rain.  From English breakfasts to
evening cocktails, the patio remains active at all hours of night or day. 
Huge, round stone planters guide patrons up to the fluted white columns
lining the cafe's red brick face.  A mansard roof slopes gently upward; at
its center rises an elegant clock in an Edwardian spire.

Lido Bar and Cafe at Hyde Park~
Red brick punctured by dormer windows face the patio and placid waters of
the lake.  The building is loud and clattery, densely populated and set
solely with booths built into the two teak walls to the right and left of
the entryway.  Similarly pale wood cut in slender slats comprise the bar and
counter; flavored syrups and antique espresso machines fit between a modern
cash register, baskets of crisps, and bread and pasty displays under domes
of glass.  The crisp black menu lists delectables that widely range in style
and culture; English breakfast is priced directly above curries, pizzettes,
hamburgers and couscous.  Everything comes with fat chips and relish;
steaming plates accompany orders as simple as coffee.  The clanks and clinks
of a working kitchen is audible despite the hum of conversation; the bar is
exposed near the entry, serving up cocktails, shots and brews on tap.

The Long Water at Hyde Park~
The serene lake follows the natural contours of the land, gently curving
toward the west, edged by a concrete berm and a modest fishing dock.  Pedal
boats are hitched to the sides of the dock; the majority blue, a fanciful
few fashioned after swans.  The Serpentine Road follows a concentric curve
to the lake, lined by Dutch Elms and shallow slopes of grass and
wildflowers.  To the northwest the elegant arches of the Serpentine Bridge
allow passage to the opposite shoreline.  To the east, water flows out of
the lake to a sluice, forming a small, ornamental waterfall.  The bridge and
lawns are given to a hard wall of aged stone to the north, opening at an
iron gate into a hedged courtyard.

Serpentine Bridge at Hyde Park~
Cast stone balusters form the parapet of the bridge, sparsely populated
by higher spires of iron-wrought lamps.  The capstones are densely coated in
graffiti, and the road between the balusters is rough with age-worn
cobblestones.  Scrolled keystones support high barrels of stone; through
them the lake freely flows.  To the north and south the broad ribbon of the
Long Water lazily ripples.  On warm days pedal boats bob through the lake,
fishermen in waders cast their lines into the deeps, and swimmers float in
gentle currents.  To the east the road curves away from the bridge to hug
the edge of the lake; west, it leads to West Carriage Way.  Toward the
middle of the bridge an angular wing wall descends toward the water.

West Carriage Drive at Hyde Park~
The gray balusters open broadly into West Carriage Drive's wide lanes of
footpaths, carriageways and modern traffic, each method of travel split by
berms of concrete, grass, scatters of daffodils and magenta snapdragons.  To
the far west the carriageway continues toward the Coalbrookdale and
Alexandra Gates.  The high red brick facade of the Serpentine Gallery,
historic estates, monuments and temples hedged in trees and grass stretch
northeast, following the slender curve of the lake.  The bowling green,
putting grounds, and junior tennis courts fill the vast corner to the
southwest, thick with maples and planes of well-tended grass.  By day the
courts and greens are booked with teams, bustling and noisy; by night
they're dimly lit and often laden under a a haze of fog.

West Carriage Drive at Hyde Park~
Evenly split by iron bollards, two lanes of modern traffic are defined
away from an idyllic walkway, an elm-lined berm of grass and wild daffodils
between the rows.  Heavy cherry trees laden thickly with snowy blooms and
purplish leaves populate vast fields of lawn; a row to the north provides a
natural barrier between the public and Queen Caroline's Temple, a classical
style summer house overlooking the Long Water.  A bronze cast statue rises
on a high concrete plinth in a footpath-veined carpet of grass to the
northwest; to the east the Carriage Drive lifts toward Serpentine Bridge and
the Long Water.  The carriageway continues south.

The Arch at Hyde Park~
On the west bank of the lake a six-meter high Roman travertine sculpture
is positioned in a field of coarse grass and oak trees.  Seven white stones
weighing forty tons rise in asymmetrical measure, resembling a hollow
vertebrae protruding from the grass.  The West Carriage Drive mulls north
and south to the west of the arch, split down the middle by daffodils and
chain-linked iron bollards.  Between the lake and the carriageway a short
spired iron fence prevents pedestrian access.  Sparse patches of reeds
cluster along the edge of the Long Water, providing habitats for noisome
frogs and families of rare, mute swans.

Rotten Row at Hyde Park~
A thick canopy branches blend paperback maples and holm oak leaves
overhead, darkening a long section of the bridleway.  The iron bollards
hedging the road peter off to the south, trailing heavy rungs of chain into
thickets of foliage.  To the north the bridleway continues; the trees open
and lose density, allowing patches of light to penetrate them.  Underfoot or
hoof the bridleway is a brick base covered by sand, wide enough to
accommodate a half-dozen carriages pulling side by side.  The dull glow of
aging oil lamps cast hazy pools over the dust and sand after nightfall.  The
occasional group of riders on horseback meander through on weekends,
exercising and training their mounts.

Rotten Row at Hyde Park~
A brick base covered by sand, wide enough to accommodate a half-dozen
carriages, runs a long bridleway from the hedges to the east; west a stately
row of ancient maple trees stand behind iron bollards.  Similar bollards
frame the opposite side of the north-south carriage drive; chain drapes
between them, hedging off footpaths and benches.  A grass berm is layered
further behind the eastern bollards, lined in slim birch trees; modern
traffic mulls in two lanes, accommodating vehicles where Rotten Row fails
them.  Dully-lit with aging oil lamps, the track is loosely maintained in
its ancient order; precautions against highwaymen still struggle serve as
precautions against muggings and worse.  By day horseback riders come and go
from the manege to the south, riding the Row and retiring to the stables.

The Manege at Hyde Park~
Low cedar hedges work sinuous pathways to and from the manege from Rotten
Row, opening into a trumpet-shaped courtyard of hard-packed dust to the
immediate south.  Five miles of bridleways, two outdoor riding arenas, an
expansive dressage yard and manicured jumping rows all culminate in a
historic stable; the Royal horses, Metropolitan Police Service mounts, and
countless members of the privately wealthy public stable and exercise their
horses on ancient grounds, close at hand to a scenic carriage drive.  Tall
Locust Trees spread their branches throughout the open-air manege, edging
the bridleways and hugging the sides of courses and stables.  Low iron
bollards connected by chain peter off the further from formal grounds one
rides; trails so ensconced in thickets and forest they accomplish rurality. 
To the west an arched bridge crosses a slender stream toward the football
pitches.

Dell Bridge at Hyde Park~
Arching eastward a cast stone bridge meets in the middle of the Long
Water, sitting lower over the lake than its northerly counterpart in the
Serpentine.  White granite balustrades and sandstone bricks create an artful
palette of color.  When the rains are especially heavy the lake is prone to
swelling over the top of the bridge, making passage challenging if not
impossible.  To the west the concrete bank is cluttered with loose patches
of reeds, leading down toward the dusty Rotten Row bridleway.  To the east
the bridge rises toward its central peak, sandstone brick underfoot, a few
aged oil lamps populating the arch on iron posts.

The Dell at Hyde Park~
Rugged planes of natural grass gently slope down into a shallow valley
among countless trees; silver maple, sweet chestnut and holm oak thickly
cluster along the dell's outskirts, with the purplish-red bursts of wild
cherry trees, weeping beeches and willows fanning further outward,
containing full ecosystems under immensely thick, curtain-like branches.  A
loose shrub thicket cleaves to the shape of a natural pond at the dell's
lowest point; wild daffodils sprout in blades and pale yellow trumpets from
the underbrush.  Hedges weave sinuous lines toward the bandstand to the
distant east.  To the west the grass slopes up and closes into a tree-lined
track.

The Bandstand at Hyde Park~
Ornately wrought iron painted with white accents rises in the center of a
broad, open clearing; Regency-style with eight delicate iron columns
supporting an octagonal ogee roof, the bandstand provides eerily flawless
acoustics for open-air performance.  The clearing is expansive enough to
accommodate hundreds of people; around it iron lamps strain to penetrate the
dark at dusk.  Layered further outward, a concentric circle of ancient oak
trees stretch and tangle branches up toward the sky.  A cobbled path weaves
away from the clearing toward Wellington Arch to the east.  To the west
hedges work thick arteries through grassy lawns, working their way toward a
tree-lined dell.

The Old Football Pitches at Hyde Park~
Coarse emerald turf carpets the pitch from end to end; dimensions and
markings defined by the Laws of the Game are sprayed in fading white.  Wood
slat bins are spaced along paths which hug the edges of the field, and low
benches are provided for makeshift audiences.  Spaced evenly along the
border between the pitch and Rotten Row's manege stand slender maples.  The
opposite border is hedged by thicker stands of trees; the Prince of Wales
lodges and Natural History Museum peer through and above trunks and
branches, distant but prominent.  By day the pitch is booked by occupants;
rugby and football games fill the field with energy and noise.

Under the Serpentine Bridge at Hyde Park~
The water is deeper than it looked from parapet, deeply green and cloudy.
Rising to the chin of an average sized man, the surface wavers and gently
ripples.  Overhead the high barrel arch is limned in moss; cast gray stone,
mottled with graffiti and dangling tendrils of rugged growth.  The wing
wall's steps are uneven and half-submerged under lake water.  They wind back
up over the bridge without hand holds or even footing, perilous on the rare
occasion temperatures drop below freezing.  Through cloudy water pools of
tiny minnows dart and flicker.  The bottom of the lake, when reached, is
slimy concrete.

Speakers' Corner at Hyde Park~
A sunburst of nine paths and seven outlying mosaics converge at a
sandstone mosaic where the Reformer's Tree once stood.  A wide, open-air
public speaking area, the 'corner' is closed on all sides by planes of grass
and the occasional span of iron-wrought fence.  The enclosure is vast,
easily accommodating hundreds of people.  By day people crowd through the
area, some standing on actual soap boxes, holding up signs and making their
opinions known.  The corner's existence is frequently upheld as a
demonstration of free speech, as anyone can turn up unannounced and talk on
almost any subject, though always at the risk of being heckled by regulars. 
To the west a reddish brick path fades into well-worn cobblestones.

mosaic~
The mosaic commemorates the 'Reformers Tree', a venerable oak which was
set ablaze during the Reform League Riots of 1866.  The remaining stump
became a noticeboard for the political demonstration and a gathering point
for Reform League meetings.  In 1977 the stump was uprooted, and the mosaic
lain where it once stood.

corner~
Though Hyde Park Speakers' Corner is considered the paved area closest to 
Marble Arch, legally the public speaking area extends beyond the Reform Tree
and covers a large area from Marble Arch to Victoria Gate, then along the 
Serpentine to Hyde Park Corner and the Broad Walk running from Hyde Park 
Corner to Marble Arch.
#n
Public riots broke out in the park in 1855, in protest over the Sunday 
Trading Bill, which forbade buying and selling on a Sunday, the only day 
working people had off. The riots were described by Karl Marx as the 
beginning of the English revolution.
#n
The Chartist movement used Hyde Park as a point of assembly for workers'
protests, but no permanent speaking location was established. The Reform 
League organized a massive demonstration in 1866 and then again in 1867, 
which compelled the government to extend the franchise to include most 
working-class men.

Victoria Embankment~
Designed in contribution to a civilized cityscape, the Victoria Embankment
both literally and figuratively keeps society from nature, acting as a fixed,
ordered boundary between civilization and the liveliness of the river. When 
schemes of redesigning the city budded in the seventeenth century, disciplining
the Thames -- incorporating it into London's care -- transformed the wildness 
of nature into a cleansed, protected, and improved river: a modern river, 
currents brown and vehemently flowing. The Victoria Embankment extends below 
Blackfriars Bridge and outstretching docks. Flat-faced, red brick warehouses 
crowned with coal chimneys are quickly being reconstituted as high rent 
offices blocks and flats, layering out toward the city proper in concentric 
circles.  Dutch Elm trees and electric carbon arc lamps run the gamut of the 
embankment, further manicuring the river's edge. To the north a reddish brick 
road leads toward the Aspley Gate at Hyde Park. East the embankment continues 
to hug the Thames, threaded in paved lanes of traffic. Nestled to the southwest
is the white Pavilion Hotel, labeled with black letters.

dragon~
The dragon boundary marks are cast iron statues of dragons on metal or
stone plinths that mark the boundaries of the City of London.  The dragons
are painted silver, with details of their wings and tongue picked out in
red.  The dragon stands on one rear leg, the other lifted against a shield,
with the right foreleg raised and the left foreleg holding a shield which
bears the City of London's coat of arms, painted in red and white.  This
stance is the equivalent of the rampant heraldic 'attitude' of the
supporters of the City's arms.

The Pavilion Hotel~
Bright, hazily painted royal blue walls with weathered steel wainscoting
rise up to the low ceiling.  A tiny crystal chandelier dangles six tiers of
prisms around blinking bulbs in the middle of a cloudy sky fresco, filling
the reception with animate light.  Blue and bronze urns are filled with
peacock feathers; tarnished bronze lampshades decorate tables that hug the
walls.  Seating is provided in over the top wingback chairs cast in gilt
bronze, lush blue velveteen cushions gold-embroidered with latin
playscripts.  Mismatched throw pillows squish in the corner of a cerulean
settee.  An ancient persian rug coats the floor, guiding feet up to the
front of the pedestal desk.  Keys are issued in old-fashioned form; dangling
on pegs behind the reception.  A long, shadowy hallway leads south, guiding
guests deeper into the hotel.

Anchored in permanent residence along the far-reaching docks, the HMS

Victoria Embankment~
The east end of Victoria Embankment houses part of the Metropolitan 
District Railway and part of the Low Level Sewer.  London's assertion of the 
rights of the rational and cleansed over the irrational and disordered 
incorporates itself tangibly in the Thames, absorbing it into the city as an 
object of its control.  The embankment provides a physical and firm divide 
between culture and nature, and a rigid enclosure of the oft-violent 
currents of the River Thames.  Flat-faced, red brick warehouses crowned with
coal chimneys are quickly being reconstituted as high rent offices blocks 
and flats, layering out toward the city proper in concentric circles. Dutch 
Elm trees and electric carbon arc lamps run the gamut of the embankment, 
further manicuring the river's edge.  To the east the Embankment dips 
beneath an overpass; Queen Victoria Street picks up and carries foot and 
vehicle traffic through densely-populated rows of high buildings.

eventually reaching Mansion House Street at Bank junction.  Broad sidewalks
and corner shops squish between massive, multi-story buildings with high
Victorian architecture; four lanes of traffic move in one-way routes,
slowing and flowing in equal time with the blink of street lights. 
Thousands of people herd up and travel down sidewalks and over crosswalks,
mulling in and out of doors; just getting where they're going.  The
Blackfriars exit from the London Underground is encased behind a stout
monolith of glass to the northwest.  A brutalist office block takes up a

Lower Thames Street~
Lower Thames Street is home to high finance and tourism, and separated
only by the London Bridge from it's Upper half.  The street stretches along
the River Thames from Westminster to Tower Hill, running more than a
half-mile of densely populated sidewalks, shops, properties and traffic
lanes.  Though Lower Thames is now separated from the river Thames and by
buildings and hotels, in the medieval period it ran closer to the river,
hugging the remnants of an ancient Roman wall.  Rugged stones climbing with
moss and ancient graffiti spear the southern sidewalk in erratic patterns,
surrounded by orderly capstones.  A distinct curve leads southward toward
the London Bridge, while to the west the overpass divides Thames Street into
halves.

Lower Thames Street~
Among Lower Thames Street's most notable buildings are St.  Magnus the
Martyr Church, the old gray brick custom-house, and Old Swan Tavern.  These
buildings, along with sites such as the steelyard and a weigh station for
imports, illustrate Thames Street's status as a well-known and well-traveled
road, serving as a major trade center in London from time antiquity. 
Georgian bow-fronted shops rise several stories, skirting the northern edge
of the street.  Old street lamps and blue plaques mark numerous custom
houses.  To the south the Thames swells and ripples in brown currents;
across the river the thick urban landscape of the London metropolitan area
is brightly-lit, illuminating the polluted sky.  To the east traffic and
sidewalks are tilted toward higher elevation.

Cannon Street~
The cobblestoned maze of through-ways and sidewalks around Cannon Street
was initially the place of residence of the candle-makers, first appearing
as 'Candelwrichstrete Street' in 1190.  The name was shortened over sixty
times as a result of the cockney dialect and settled on Cannon Street in the
17th century -- therefore not related to the firearms.  In the late 19th
century Cannon Street was occupied by large wholesale warehouses, especially
of cotton goods and other fabrics; countless such warehouses still crowd the
embankment, red brick crowned with dozens of black-crusted coal chimneys. 
Tucked into a narrow northern alleyway a cobblestone walk leads to bleak
shadow accentuated by the globes of dull, antique oil lamps.  To the west
Thames Street broadens into multiple lanes of descending traffic.

center, runs roughly parallel with the River Thames.  In the west, Cannon
Street starts at St.  Paul's Churchyard outside St Paul's Cathedral; running
west it meets Thames Street near Mansion House tube station.  In the late
19th century Cannon Street was occupied by large wholesale warehouses,
especially of cotton goods and other fabrics; countless such warehouses
still crowd the embankment, red brick crowned with dozens of black-crusted
coal chimneys.  Behind a protective, curiously curling grate of mint green
iron the ancient London Stone resides in the wall of St.  Swithin's Church.

Cannon Street at Tower Bridge~
The two bridge towers are tied together at the upper level by two
horizontal walkways, designed to withstand the horizontal tension forces
exerted by the suspended sections of the bridge on landward sides.  The
vertical components are carried by two robust Victorian towers, with the
bascule pivots and operating machinery housed in the base of each.  The
bridge deck is freely accessible to both vehicles and pedestrians, whereas
the bridge's twin towers, high-level walkways and Victorian engine rooms
form part of the Tower Bridge Exhibition.  The nearest London Underground
tube stations are Tower Hill to the east, London Bridge, and Tower Gateway. 
To the west Cannon Street slopes steadily down to lower elevation.  East,
All Hallows-by-the-Tower overlooks the Tower of London.  To the north a long
lane leads toward a well-preserved Georgian square.

Tower Gateway~
The sprawling collection of buildings, walls, towers, moats, gates and
fields called The Tower of London was begun shortly by William the Conqueror
after the Norman invasion in 1066.  In the near-thousand years since, the
Tower to the north has been enlarged and modified by successive monarchs,
and has seen more history than most castles -- as a royal palace, imposing
fortress, feared prison and gruesome place of execution, royal mint, military 
arsenal, private zoo, and repository of the Crown Jewels.  The site of the
tower rests near a key river crossing, close to port landings at the southeast 
corner of the old Roman walls of London.  Bridges drop over ancient moats, now
grassed over.  Across the Thames red London buses and pedestrians whiz across 
Tower Bridge to the London metropolitan area.  The bascules raise to allow 
river vessels to sail beneath it.  To the south, bolstered up close against
the crowded embankment, the All Hallows-by-the-Tower Anglican church lifts its
high spire into the skies.

Trinity Gardens at the Tower of London~
Trinity Square Gardens, just north of Tower Hill tube station, was once
the site of hundreds of executions.  Today it bears an atmosphere of
cautious tranquility, ringed with prominent buildings and portions of the
wall that once enclosed the Roman settlement of Londinium.  To the north is
Trinity House, topped with a ship's weathervane.  To the northwest the
massive Port of London Authority building has been converted into
residential blocks and the Ten Trinity Square hotel.  The Tower Hill
Memorial's austere marbled facade rests to the southeast, dedicated to the
almost twenty-five thousand merchant sailors who died in both world wars and
have no known grave.  A grassy courtyard before the tube's main is home to a
solid stretch of the medieval wall built on Roman foundations, with a modern
statue of Emperor Trajan looming in full regalia.  The most striking display
clusters around the Tower walls: eight hundred thousand delicate, red
ceramic poppies, each representing a British fatality during World War I;
the green and tranquil grass in the middle of a bustling city suddenly
spills over with bright, violent red.  Reflection benches pepper the gardens
and courtyards.

Bedford Square~
Bedford Square, the best-preserved Georgian square in London, is designed
as a whole and surrounded by the smoky gray, flat-faces of its original
Georgian terrace houses.  At its heart lies its private garden, a spacious,
leafy haven in the midst of of a bustling metropolis.  The street typifies
late Georgian and early Victorian style, built on top of the St Giles's
rookery made famous by Dickens.  The estates and flats possess a dedicated
gardening team, carefully cherishing its historic lawns, stately maple trees
and shrubberies; recently established features include a Victorian inspired
stumpery and a Japanese border, locked neatly away in the square's private
gardens.  From the south Cannon Street's east and west lanes flood the
square with the hazy sounds of traffic.

Threadneedle Street~
The wide back end of an elaborate wedge high-rise splits four lanes of
traffic down the middle on Threadneedle, enforcing the sweeping lines of a
noisy roundabout.  The bustle of activity through high Edwardian buildings
is anguished and vehement; fast-paced and heavily trafficked, everyone
appears to be just getting to where they're going, using the four lanes and
roundabouts as a through-way to 'somewhere else.  ' The corners are all
carved in stone and brick; not a single building levels under five stories. 
To the south the road's aged bricks give way to cobblestones at Bedford
Square.  North the borough of Lothbury stretches outward.  To the east
Rainham Close street winds a sinuous route toward Greenwich and Brixton.

An elaborate wedge high-rise stands in the mouth of Threadneedle's
westerly opening, Edwardian in design, sooty white brick in material.  Thick
glass windows span up seven stories, populated with flats and offices; on
the ground floor a abandoned pub hides behind securely latched grates.  The
bustle of Threadneedle is anguished and vehement; fast-paced and heavily
trafficked, everyone appears to be just getting to where they're going,
using the four lanes and roundabouts as a through-way to 'somewhere else.  '
The corners are all carved in stone and brick; not a single building levels
under five stories.  To the west the street rises toward Ludgate Hill.  To

Ludgate Hill~
Rising over one of the three ancient hills of London, Ludgate Hill
reaches its highest point here at St.  Paul's Cathedral, a magnificent,
white Baroque church with an expansive churchyard, twin clocktowers rising
high astride the central dome and spire.  Many small alleys on Ludgate Hill
were swept away to build the monolith railway station to the northwest.  To
the immediate north the Paternoster Square houses the home of the London
Stock Exchange, crawling with incessant activity.  Victorian, Edwardian and
Georgian buildings face the streetsides, broken on occasion by overpass
bridges.  To the east traffic buzzes toward Threadneedle Street.

Ludgate Hill~
Rising over one of the three ancient hills of London, Ludgate Hill
crosses from the bustling New Bridge Street to the west to the old Ludgate;
a gate with an attached medieval gaol, still standing in crumbling mold
amidst a host of modern office buildings, banks, corner chippies, pubs and
shops.  Traditionally the site of a Roman temple to the goddess Diana, only
the foundation now stands to the north of the road, hemmed in by sidewalks
and a low cedar hedge.  Many small alleys on Ludgate Hill were swept away to
build the monolith railway station to the northeast.  To the south four
lanes of traffic shrink to a one-way road, leading into the austere bustle
of Southwark.

New Bridge Street~
To the west the low bustle of Fleet Street etches out territory; to the
east Ludgate Hill claims ground.  North, a great deal of traffic flows in
from Farringdon Street.  New Bridge Street is immersed in history, with more
than its share of mind-blowing antiquity and historic splendor.  The eight
lanes of traffic, bicycle and pedestrian paths are crowded in by a labyrinth
of milestones in the city's unique and compelling biography; architectural
statements layering centuries of style.  The Shard's glittering glass spire
and a notoriously gherkin-shaped high-rise provide enough innovation to put
a crackle in the air, but these sparkling touches of modern urbanity fail to
drown out the West End's well-preserved, centuries old narrative. 
Architectural grandeur rises up all around New Bridge Street, ancient
remains dot the shadows of alleys, and pubs punctuate the ground level of
wedge buildings that split the traffic lanes.

Fleet Street~
The home of London's newspaper industry; its name is still used as a
generic term for the national press.  Fleet Street is a frantically busy
stretch of the connecting route between New Bridge Street and the borough of
Bethnal Green.  Called a "double street" on account of the equal frenzy
weaving through its alleys and passageways, the foot traffic in every meter
of space is a genuine problem for vehicular travel.  Protruding signboards
are mounted above every doorway, rising up several stories to the highest
levels; one of these fell down in 1718 and killed four people, including the
King's jeweler.  Since the 1500s the press has driven out most of Fleet
Street's other businesses, filling every space from ground to sky.

Bethnal Green~
Dim as a dusty candle, Bethnal Green is home to a jarring contrast of the
destitute and creeping gentrification.  The neighborhood's back alleys
remain dark and dodgy, but an influx of boutique hotels and nightlife
centers are filtering fresh blood into the streets.  Art galleries and
lounges share space with a resident cast of gentleman's clubs -- the sort of
low-class venues that lend the borough its illicit atmosphere.  Home to
starving artists, musicians, and vagrants who have set up residences in old
smokestack warehouses, everywhere are reminders that Bethnal Green is a
place that seedy people call home.  From vagabonds to bond traders, Bethnal
Green is London's most diverse neighborhood.  Dilapidated storefronts and
warehouses are in part occupied by thriving havens for the arts.  To the
south, Viajante restaurant has claimed the old town hall, turning it into an
informal gastronomic experience for the culinarily inquisitive.  To the
north Chancery Lane curves sinuously through a tree-lined through-way.

A narrow alley in Bethnal Green~
Framed on all sides by the looming red brick walls of post-industrial
warehouses, the alley is dark, damp, and reeks of mold.  Shockingly little
light makes its way into the alley; even during the height of day the
structures block all but the thinnest sliver of sunlight from reaching the
lower halves of the walls.  Puddles are permanent, filling the gaps in long
forgotten cobblestones.  A bizarre series of symbols are spray-painted onto
the foundation in the northeastern corner, vividly red -- frequently
freshened.

Rainham Close~
Course squares of lawn fill the space between the sidewalks and endless
rows of brick, two-story flats.  The metropolitan bustle of London is kept
momentarily at bay in this residential neighborhood; a few traditional black
taxis take side-routes down the cracked pavement, but otherwise the row is
relatively spared from traffic.  The majority of homes are attached -- on
occasion semi-detached Victorians fit into a corner.  Most driveways are
paved with brick.  The occasional playground or garden fence closes off the
minimal lawns each lot possess.  Large, dull steel streetlamps line the
sidewalks.  To the west the buildings rise up dramatically higher, curving
through a roundabout toward Threadneedle Street.

Brixton Borough~
Brixton's widely-untended cobblestones and weathered edifices embrace its
unapologetically unpolished reputation.  Evolving from a site of controversy
and struggle during the 1990's, Brixton has steadily increased its appeal
without losing much of its cosmopolitan make-up.  The neighborhood replaces
Britain's acclaimed architecture and posh boutiques with homespun culture
and more than a bit of the crass.  Brixton's diverse community lends the
neighborhood a sincerely lived-in feel.  Tower block buildings house
countless flats, terraces cluttered with plants and laundry.  To the south
of Flower Street the sweet smell of cake batter infuses the air.  A highly
suburban neighborhood meanders west, walled behind ancient bricks.  To the
east the borough thickens.

art galleries, local markets, and pop-up restaurants in Brixton Village
Market.  By wandering through the market the origins of the residents become
clear; it overflows with a variety of goods and products from around the
world, occupying the entirety of the lower southeastern corner.  Tropical
foods, home-burned CDs, and exotic fabrics are all purchasable in a single
visit.  The Ritzy cinema stands to the north of the street, six doors
revolving under an old-fashioned marquee.  To the south lies the two-story
Geek Chic.

Haggerston Borough~
Haggerston's worn-in atmosphere is attributed to its motley mix of
progressively designed apartment complexes, orderly cafe counters, and
meticulously boarded up windows.  Sharing the same offbeat attitude as
nearby Brixton, artists and students often congregate in Haggerston -- a
neighborhood known for its laissez-faire attitude, where unpredictability is
expected.  This northeast London locale is best suited to those who
appreciate a graffiti-friendly aesthetic and an everyday, multicultural
community.  Like several communities along Regent's Canal, Haggerston is
enjoying a neighborhood revival as creative minds use old spaces for new
endeavors.  The canal itself has been embraced as a natural amenity, with
modern apartments breaking ground along its banks.  Street art pervades
intrepidly imaginative empty spaces; blank walls and the faces of red brick
warehouses.  A bicycle is the best -- and frequently only -- way of
exploring Haggerston.  Traffic is so congested that even the smallest taxis
avoid the roads.

makes the centuries fade away.  Still lit by three large, working gaslights,
the Georgian bow-fronted shops, black doors and highly polished brass knobs
and knockers evoke a lost age, while brass plates announce the names of the
businesses therein.  Arched cellar doors wedge in the corners between the
cobblestones and red brick walls.  Window displays are eye-catching, though
the shopfronts have little architectural elaboration.  To the north a small
opening reveals the anguished, half-Edwardian bustle of Threadneedle Street.

Borough of Southwark~
Like the perfect pot of afternoon tea, Southwark has been culturally
steeping for centuries.  The neighborhood is home to many of the city's
iconic landmarks -- some of London's most iconic bridges, buildings, and
museums are located in Southwark.  Brick and steel overpasses run alongside
transparent glass facades and stone cathedrals; from the tallest stories
panoramic views of history abutting modernity reveal themselves in flawless
urbanity.  Old brick warehouses line the roadways; some have been remodeled
into ultra-modern marvels while others remain endearingly sooty.  The
tunnels under bridges serve grander purposes than simple passageways --
nightclubs create nocturnal attractions, and when the day turns dark Cable
nightclub opens its unassuming doors.  Luminous vaulted bridges contrast
Southwark's dark tunnel spaces and alleys; the neighborhood's striking
contradictions only add to its visual mystique.

A one-way, tree-lined street forms the western boundary of London.  The
lane that once connected the Knights Templar to their temples in Holborn has
taken on a decidedly urban character in the last three centuries; while
retaining its vast Georgian buildings, a steady rise of legal offices and
solicitors take premises on Chancery Lane, filling the antique shops where
wig makers, strongbox makers, law stationers and booksellers once peddled
their skills and wares.  Antique cobblestones pave the street, necessitating
slow vehicular traffic.  Sidewalks dotted with old iron lamps struggle to
illuminate the weaving maze of alleyways branching out from here through the
city of London.  Down an unmarked passage to the west an old, smooth
structure of stone and brickwork stands.  To the south the Borough of
Bethnal Green spreads out like a cancer.

tower is situated on the eastern side of Chancery Lane, standing tall behind
a well-tended lawn.  Hedges and stately trees line the walkway to the
library doors.

West End~
The Royal Academy of Arts hosts exhibitions, discussions, and events to
promote the visual arts to the north, sequestered away behind four layered
levels of ornate, grayish cream Regency architecture.  Pennant flags drape
down the face of the academy, tumbling to the tips of an iron-spired fence. 
An enclosed bus stop is situated between two tall iron streetlamps.  To the
northwest Chinatown is packed with colorful restaurants.  Everything is on
display in storefront window, and bright red paper lanterns drape from tall,
historic buildings, crossing the street up and down the entire ward.  Pubs
serving traditional fish and chips and bars serving contemporary small
plates saturate the West End with endless options.  Black Hackney carriages
zip easily down sidestreets and alleys.  The road cuts sharply south toward
Chancery Lane.

West End~
From its commercial plazas to its side streets and back alleys, the West
End whirs with unyielding, not necessarily positive energy.  The West End is
home to London's two most famous squares, Leicester Square and Trafalgar
Square.  Trafalgar Square's statuesque lions stoically watch over the
plaza's incessant activity, black iron and four in number, indifferently
gazing through white and brown structural antiquity.  Nelson's Column stands
proudly at the square's center.  Locals and tourists descend on Oxford
Street, the West End's answer to commercial pursuits.  Every
hole-in-the-wall shop on the ground level of bustling streetsides is filled
to the brim with chains or local curiosities.  Iconic double-decker buses
and smart car cabs weave freely through three lanes of traffic.  To the east
New Bridge Street's massive through-way turns at a subtle angle.

New Bridge Street~
To the east the Old Bailey follows the line of the City of London's
fortified wall; to the west West End's heavy, solid crowding narrows traffic
down to two lanes.  North and south, New Bridge Street is immersed in
history, with more than its share of mind-blowing antiquity and historic
splendor.  The eight lanes of traffic, bicycle and pedestrian paths are
crowded in by a labyrinth of milestones in the city's unique and compelling
biography; architectural statements layering centuries of style.  The
Shard's glittering glass spire and a notoriously gherkin-shaped high-rise
provide enough innovation to put a crackle in the air, but these sparkling
touches of modern urbanity fail to drown out the West End's well-preserved,
centuries old narrative.  Architectural grandeur rises up all around New
Bridge Street, ancient remains dot the shadows of alleys, and pubs punctuate
the ground level of wedge buildings that split the traffic lanes.

Old Bailey~
A three-story Italianate, white brick building spans the entirety of the
block upon which it was built; the Old Bailey, just outside the western wall
of the City of London, named after the street on which it is located, which
itself follows the line of the original bailey.  The Central Criminal Court
is held in the Old Bailey, beautifully invited through arches carved with
scales and axioms.  The glittering bronze cast statue of Lady Justice rests
atop the highest spire above the court's central dome; the dome is supported
by doric columns, and long, capstone windows run orderly rows on all three
levels of the building.  The architecture up and down Bailey reflects the
regal elegance of the court.  Wide traffic lanes mull with cautious vehicles
and less-cautious pedestrians.  Old Dutch Elm trees flare their branches in
tended fans between the antique street lamps.  The road curves steadily left
onto New Bridge Street.

King Edward Street~
Little more than an alley lined with black iron terraces and arched
cellar doors that hug close to the foundations of post-industrial
warehouses, King Edward Street is home to a shockingly complete silence. 
Rats frequently tumble and forage through the bags of garbage that have been
piling up for decades.  To the south the alley opens into the jarringly
contradictory municipal district of London.  To the north the alley darkens
and the walls seem to loom in closer.  High above, a laundry line connects
from the western warehouse to the east, dangling battered and rain-soaked
Union Jack pennant flags.

Little more than an alley lined with black iron terraces and arched
cellar doors that hug close to the foundations of post-industrial
warehouses, King Edward Street is home to a shockingly complete silence.  A
three-hundred year old pub fits into the east wall: two shops knocked
together, wood-heavy interior visible through the greasy window panes.  Rats
frequently tumble and forage through the bags of garbage that pile up around
the tavern's door.  To the north the alley opens into the bleak dark of
King's Cross.  To the south the alley slithers onward.

King's Cross~
At a glance, not a single bulb on the wrought iron streetlamps is lit by
day or night; some of the glass tops are shattered, others are simply
missing.  Those few that remain intact are dark.  The end of World War II
marked the beginning of fierce decline in King's Cross; life simply left
this bastion of post-industrial brick and mortar.  Once-industrial brick
warehouses are re-imagined as flop-houses for the homeless and worse,
ensuring the borough's seedy reputation goes unshed.  Pubs still stake their
claim in King's Cross, struggling for visibility through sooty windows. 
Both loose and bagged refuse spills out of the countless alleys slithering
through abandoned cathedrals, warehouses and taped off, collapsed tube
entrances.  To the west a long bridge floating over an industrial river
winds steadily toward fairer ground at Covent Garden.  South, King Edward
Street's narrow lane slips between two block towers.

Cross Station forms a single beacon of overt activity, inviting strangers
and travelers through an otherwise secluded district.

Farringdon Street~
Farringdon Street is a densely-packed study in contrasts; a jarring
amalgamation of antique and modern architecture, skyscrapers and
centuries-old custom houses casting dense shadows over the constant motion
of red buses and taxis which herding along the multi-lane road.  Countless
alleys, some sequestered behind scrolled iron grates, some open to the
streetsides reeking of refuse, slither complex labyrinths through brutalist
flats and neo-classical high-rises.  A striking lack of lampposts occupy the
sidewalks or center berm.  After dusk the headlamps of cars and buses mingle
with the red, green and yellow glow of the traffic lights; beyond these and
thousands of occupied windows, all else is dark.  King's Cross turns
languorously eastward, gloomy and dully-lit.

Farringdon Street~
A broad thoroughfare runs north and south down Farringdon Street, skirting 
between the towering blocks of historic buildings, v-shaped Victorian wedges 
and the modern, jarringly visible high-rises; glass monstrosities and 
treasures alike, questionably modeled after modern architecture.  A stout 
dividing wall separates the flow of traffic, broken only by the towering 
concrete supports of the overpass bridges. Sidewalks and bicycle lanes flank
the street on both sides, running dangerously close to the open mouths of
heavily-shadowed alleys.

Farringdon Street~
Flat-faced buildings of in varying shades of gray and brown frame
Farringdon Street's southernmost stretch, speckled amidst modern, taller
cousins.  The broad thoroughfare is hedged in rough cobblestone sidewalks. 
Litter chokes the rain gutters and overflows from public bins.  Massive
maple trees crowd the sidewalks, branches peppering the cobbles with leaves.
Shops, public houses, tenement flats and offices fill up faster than the
city can produce them.  Constant, heavy traffic mulls red buses, taxis and
private vehicles up and down four well-marked lanes, with the majority
flowing south toward New Bridge Street.

Covent Garden~
Covent Garden's central square remains this neighborhood's primary
attraction, but its fetching streetscape doesn't end with the bustling
marketplace, visible to the north in a fantastical frame of mint green iron
and glass.  Street performers and food stalls share Covent Gardens' iconic
plaza and winding side streets with cheese shops, casual taverns, art
museums, and opera houses that cater to those looking for less trafficked
locales.  The Piazza is the heart of Covent Garden, where tourists,
shoppers, meanderers, performers, lovers and friends crowd together in the
neighborhood's famous square.  Pocket change is perpetually palmed over to
the countless entertainers and diversions in this unyieldingly charming
neighborhood.  To the west the idyllic block ends and West Smithfield
begins.

Covent Garden~
A large selection of shops, from high-street brands to designer labels,
pack in red brick Georgian buildings; black-framed windows and iron bollards
cut in sidewalks.  Between them the street is soft brick, worn down over
centuries of foot traffic.  The Tea House to the north of the walkway bears
a crowded window display, each framed pane filled with a different type of
tea; from Earl Grey to Japanese Genmaicha Green.  18th century bow windows
are packed across a quarter mile stretch to the south, lit with genuine gas
lamps.  To the east rests Aldgate, the eastern-most gateway through the
London Wall leading from the Square Mile to East End and White Chapel.

Aldgate~
Aldgate is the eastern-most gateway through the London Wall leading from
the City of London to Whitechapel and Covent Garden, taking in roads from
Camden Town and splitting eight lanes of traffic.  The gateway and its two
circular towers stand at the corner of the modern Duke's Palace, with a busy
thoroughfare passing through it.  Like London's other gates, Aldgate is
fortified with portcullises and chained, constructed in a more classical
than functional style.  Tall iron street lamps flank the sidewalks like rows
of soldiers, casting globes of yellow light on wet cobblestones.

Whitechapel~
Supporting an alternative scene within the heart of the city, Whitechapel
often challenges established norms.  Both classic and cutting edge,
Whitechapel is home to well-attended mosques, historical buildings like the
Royal London Hospital, and avant-garde movements spearheaded by
world-renowned museums like Whitechapel Art Gallery.  The neighborhood
embodies struggle, survival, and success -- its tumultuous past and sooty
exterior cannot overshadow the achievements of its staid residents and
unflinching creativity.  London's largest Bangladeshi population lives in
Whitechapel, contributing to an unusually dense number of curry stands and
open-air, colorful Indian markets.  Graffiti is everywhere, alleys are dark
and hundreds of ancient buildings date all the way from the medieval period
to Victorian custom houses.  To the west the Aldgate splits the road,
dividing London into West and East End.

Whitechapel~
On the eastern quarter of Whitechapel, Brick Lane beckons outdoor art
enthusiasts and large scale expressionists to wander its sidewalks and
ponder its wall space.  The neighborhood becomes more and more mixed the
closer to the Moorgate it crowds.  A residential block of massive red brick
flats -- each story fitted with its own curving pipe of coal chimneys --
hint at the district's dark past.  The docks of Wapping and the textile
manufacturing warehouses stand empty with broken windows, crowding corners
and layering between custom houses.  A mixture of tower block housing and
modern developments strain to overcome the edge of despondence lingering at
the before St.  John's Gate.

St. John's Gate~
A surprisingly out-of-place Tudor gate crafted of blunt gray stone -- no
Victorian folly but the real deal, dating back to the 12th century and the
Knights Hospitaller.  Inside is a small museum that covers the history of
the order, as well as its 19th-century revival in Britain as the secular
Order of St John and the foundations of St.  John Ambulance.  The gate was
built in 1504 as a grand entrance to the priory; though most of the
buildings were destroyed when Henry VIII dissolved every monastery in the
country, the gate survived.  It had a varied afterlife, not least as a
Latin-speaking coffee house run, without much success, by William Hogarth's
father during Queen Anne's reign.  Restored in the 19th century, it also
housed the Old Jerusalem Tavern, where writers and artists, including
Charles Dickens, frequently met.  To the east the streets lead toward Sun
Street and Hackney.  To the west, Whitechapel's notorious Brick Lane hugs
along a darkened city dock.

traffic, three bicycle lanes and mottled concrete sidewalks.  While in the
glittering west the glass monoliths of the Shard and Gherkin shine over
mazes of rooftops and coal chimneys, here the divide between the Square Mile
and Hackney is struggling for light.  Near every iron alley gate bears a
broken lock or smashed hinges; vagrants slumber down cobblestone passages
and smack heads harass passersby for pounds.  The Georgian brick is
assaulted with artless graffiti on a daily basis; profanity and half-hatched
political sentiments.  To the west the road splits around a wide roundabout,
leading toward St.  John's Gate.

Haggerston Borough~
Haggerston's worn-in atmosphere is attributed to its motley mix of
progressively designed apartment complexes, orderly cafe counters, and
meticulously boarded up windows.  Sharing the same offbeat attitude as
nearby Brixton, artists and students often congregate in Haggerston -- a
neighborhood known for its laissez-faire attitude, where unpredictability is
expected.  This northeast London locale is best suited to those who
appreciate a graffiti-friendly aesthetic and an everyday, multicultural
community.  Like several communities along Regent's Canal, Haggerston is
enjoying a neighborhood revival as creative minds use old spaces for new
endeavors.  The canal itself has been embraced as a natural amenity, with
modern apartments breaking ground along its banks.  Street art pervades
intrepidly imaginative empty spaces; blank walls and the faces of red brick
warehouses.  A bicycle is the best -- and frequently only -- way of
exploring Haggerston.  Traffic is so congested that even the smallest taxis
avoid the roads.

Royal Borough of Greenwich~
Taking international trend-setting to new extremes, the world sets its
watch to Greenwich Mean Time.  Greenwich not only establishes the benchmark
for global time keeping, it's also home to architectural splendor, forested
parks, rich maritime history, and popular antiques markets.  Victorian and
Georgian buildings lend the neighborhood a rustic opulence, while the ships
docked along its southeast London banks serve as an ever-present reminder of
nautical inclinations.  Narrow streets are lined with boutiques and local
restaurants.  An abundance of traditional British food is on offer, from pie
and mash to fish and chips.  High Street bears countless pubs, and Grand
Victorian buildings make ideal spaces for sprawling apartments with high
ceilings.  Leafy and green with innumerable old houses and open spaces,
families who move to Greenwich tend to stay for generations.  To the south
an unremarkable suburban neighborhood sprawls, lined in modern streetlights.

Belgravia Borough~
Belgravia is regal London dressed in its Sunday best.  Classical
architecture, white stucco residences, and stone churches characterize the
neighborhood's fashionably restrained streets.  Its aristocratic ambiance
comes at a high price, but the borough's secluded gardens and private
estates are unmatched.  Although daunting refinement places Belgravia in a
class of its own, the neighborhood remains close to destinations that
encourage relaxation: taverns and wine bars cloud the ground floors of
historic buildings.  As one of London's wealthiest areas, Belgravia boasts
multi-million dollar homes and celebrity residents.  This immaculate
community is predominately residential, but it borders livelier
neighborhoods like Chelsea and Pimlico.  Sought-after residences often fetch
millions and foreign embassies represent their nations in Belgrave Square. 
Belgravia doesn't reserve perfection just for its homes; the neighborhood's

Camden Town~
Leather, studs, and combat boots are common apparel in Camden Town, an
alternative oasis away from the prestige of royalty and Parliament.  More
often than not, Camden Town's building facades feature politically charged
commentary and saturated hues that pay homage to Pop art.  Question
authority is not required of enjoying the north London neighborhood --
numerous pubs, music venues, and street markets exude invitingly creative
atmospheres.  Distinctive streetscapes greet visitors from the moment they
exit the tube at Camden Town Station.  Tourists, teenagers, and Londoners
flock in to walk, shop, and engage in spirited talk.  By maneuvering
bustling crowds and high-trafficked streets glimpses of each stall and
shop's cheeky merchandise is provided.  Camden Lock is a manually-operated
twin lock bridge that connects the East waterways with the West of London. 
An outcropping of old stone bridges span an artificial canal that carries
tourists to Little Venice, Maida Vale.

Knightsbridge~
As an epicenter of prestigious vocations and inimitable style,
exclusivity reigns in Knightsbridge.  Its towering, columned edifices are

seems to notice: From its residences to its residents, Knightsbridge is
immaculate, well-bred and well-behaved.  The neighborhood's famous

Hallway at the Pavilion Hotel~
Framed photographs of eclectic celebrity guests are clustered in with
ovular Victorian portraits; the walls are lined from ceiling to floor in
faces.  The dim, flickering lighting is provided in sconces fashioned after
golden antlers; tea candles line the branching horns.  The doors to the
hotel rooms are surprisingly simple for what lies behind them -- heavy,
thick wood fitted with locks and bolts, swinging outward from the hall into
fantastic spaces.  A persian rug runner carpets the center walkway, covering
smokey black tiles with warmth.  The corkscrew staircase runs a tight spiral
through the ceiling, leading to an ornate trap door.  Downward the stairs
open broadly, revealing hints of light and cobalt carpet in the basement
salon.

"Indian Summer" at the Pavilion~
A dark gem of a room, small but exquisite, "Indian Summer" is boldly
painted a vivid shade of pink, often quoted as "the navy blue of India". 
The vivid pink in turn has been elaborately and painstakingly over-painted
with golden swirls reminiscent of the art nouveau artist Gustav Klimt;
curling intones, bringing to mind the intangible animation of heat waves.  A
sub-Continental flavor is evoked by the use of heavy colonial furniture, a
teak four-poster bed and sumptuous, darkly purple brocade fabrics.  Colored
glass and crystal lanterns complete the picture, giving the room the feel of
being locked in an exotic jewelery box.  A checked quilt with massive
squares of gold, purple and pink fabric is cast across the foot of the bed. 
Purple velvet ottomans pepper the Persian rug that runs wall to wall; a faux
gilt privacy screen divides the room in pointless portions.

"Better Red Than Dead" at the Pavilion~
An intimate double bedded room decorated entirely in shades of red, a
voluptuous symphony of claret, vermilion and burgundy, elegantly combined
with antique French furniture, theatrical curtains and flamboyant velvet bed
hangings.  The result is an enchanting and original room, peacefully located
at the back of the building.  A dark walnut vanity table dating back to
Edwardian styles sits at the beside, housing a menagerie of gold
curiosities; figurines, a hand-mirror, jewelery box and hair brush.  Tiny,
red gold lampshades arch in pairs from the red-papered walls; gold fleur de
lys' pattern the wallpaper.  The sheets on the beds are brilliant blood red
satin with embossed patterns in gold, swept under rumpled velveteen covers. 
A television is mounted high in the top right corner.

"Enter the Dragon" at the Pavilion~
Highly oriental bordello in style, this is a spacious, first floor
balcony room with twin beds draped in richly crimson silk.  The spirit of
Eastern exoticism is captured by the extensive use of imagery and patterns
-- on dark bronze walls, draping silk curtains, even the ceiling -- and by
the carefully assembled collection of Chinese treasures: carved and gilded
wooden masks compete for attention with antique wedding chests and intricate
screens, while an English Victorian bamboo desk reminds occupants of the
West's fascination with the East.  Red tassels dangle from the bed curtains
and window dressings.  The light is provided in a golden glow, seeping out
from under ridged red shades.

"White Days Soul Nights" at the Pavilion~
A light and frothy confection in shades of white and cream, "White Days,
Soul Nights" is a peaceful attic room with a double bed and a deliciously
airy feel.  Restrained, painted antique French furniture is offset by white
painted floor boards, whilst magnificent gilt and crystal wall sconces lend
an opulent note of effete perfection.  A window pelmet imaginatively
fashioned from an antique wedding dress is the finishing touch on the
northern wall, revealing the emerald green expanse of Hyde Park's urban
oasis through heavy, rain-speckled glass.  White iron scrolling wreaths the
full length mirror beside the claw-footed ivory bathtub.  The vanity table
is petite and cream colored, fit into a corner; a padded bench with tufted
seating rests before it, strewn with a white crocheted throw.

The Black Friar Public House~
Built on the site of a 13th-century Dominican Priory, the interior of The
Black Friar is a work of art nouveau extravaganza.  The walls are made from
swirls of cream and golden marble; jolly friars appear everywhere in
sculptures, mosaics and bronze reliefs, and a church-like bar with English
ale on tap stands jarringly against the impression of religious antiquity. 
The Friar is a traditional pub of unique character, revered for its eclectic
range of real ales and its comforting food, which are served, as they should
be, with a generous measure of famous British hospitality.  Marred, round
tables are ringed with matching black walnut stools throughout the main
floor.  Through a high dormer window a beer garden is spied, clustering
close to the back wall.

The Silver Salon at the Pavilion~
Hidden away in the basement of the Pavilion, an unassuming paneled door
rests open to reveal a glittering salon well-convinced by its own opulence
and magnificence.  No expense has been spared in the creation of an eclectic, 
arguably formal space, its impressive proportions alone testament to the size 
of the upstairs rooms.  The walls have been painstakingly decorated with 
silver leaf to give the impression of a hall of mirrors, set against a 
background of deep, cobalt blue paint.  A rare Anglo-Indian carved table 
divides the room into contrasting halves, one sophisticated and masculine 
with damask upholstery and rich Turkish textiles, the other feminine with 
delicate, gilded French chairs and gilt console tables. Sumptuous silk 
curtains are draped elegantly beneath lavish organza pelmets, shimmering 
seductively in the light of Italian chandeliers and old church candlesticks.
The tromp l'oeil painted ceiling of clouded sky is a triumphant conclusion to
the space.  A corkscrew staircase rests outside the door, leading back up
into the main body of the hotel.

Shakespeare's Globe Theater~
Unlike other venues for Shakespearean plays, the new Globe is designed to
resemble the original as closely as possible, including an arena open to the
fickle London skies, leaving the seven hundred "groundlings" to stand in the
city's notorious downpours.  The building is constructed entirely of English
oak, with mortise and tenon joints; no structural steel was used.  The seats
are simple benches rising in playhouse tiers, and the Globe has the first
and only thatched roof permitted in London since the Great Fire of 1666,
both treated with fire retardants and generously equipped with sprinklers. 
The stage pit has a concrete surface and an extensive backstage support area
for actors and musicians.  To the north the reception opens in wide oaken
doors, swinging out toward a brick-hedged and lamp-lit stairway between the
Globe and Southwark.

lore~
Despite the worldwide popularity of Shakespeare over the centuries, the
Globe was almost a distant memory when American actor (and, later, film
director) Sam Wanamaker came searching for it in 1949.  Undeterred by the
fact that the theater's foundations had vanished beneath a row of
heritage-listed Georgian houses, Wanamaker set up the Globe Playhouse Trust
in 1970 and began fund-raising for a memorial theater.  Work started only
200m from the original Globe site in 1987, but Wanamaker died four years
before it opened in 1997.

Borough of Southwark~
Like the perfect pot of afternoon tea, Southwark has been culturally
steeping for centuries.  The neighborhood is home to many of the city's
iconic landmarks -- some of London's most iconic bridges, buildings, and
museums are located in Southwark.  Brick and steel overpasses run alongside
transparent glass facades and stone cathedrals; from the tallest stories
panoramic views of history abutting modernity reveal themselves in flawless
urbanity.  Old brick warehouses line the roadways; some have been remodeled
into ultra-modern marvels while others remain endearingly sooty.  Luminous
vaulted bridges contrast Southwark's dark tunnel spaces and alleys; the
neighborhood's striking contradictions only add to its visual mystique. 
White exterior walls framed with naked timbers rise up high in a thatch
roofed structure; the only thatching in London since the Great Fire, pressed
between a pair of slightly taller Edwardian high-rises to the south.  A
brick-edged and lamp-lit stairway leads up from the rear end of Southwark to
the curious structure, identifiable at a glance as Shakespeare's Globe
Theater.

All Hallows-by-the-Tower~
Built on the site of a Roman building with traces of ancient pavement
still lining the crypt, the church has been expanded and rebuilt several
times throughout well over a thousand years, layering architecture
throughout countless centuries of style.  The outer walls are 15th century,
hedging in a 7th century Saxon arch doorway from the original church. 
Brasses riddle the interior; three outstanding wooden statues of saints
guide the faithful up to an exquisite Baptismal font cover, one of the
finest pieces of carving in England.  The altar is of plain stone from the
castle of Richard I at Athlit in the Holy Land.  Ancient, well-swept wood
floors lead through rows of hardy oak pews, all facing the baroque windows
looking out over the River Thames.

lore~
During the 1666 Great Fire, English diarist Samuel Pepys -- who lived
very nearby -- climbed the church tower at All Hallows to watch the
spreading conflagration before being forced to evacuate to the South Bank. 
The 1666 fire began less than a quarter mile away in Pudding Lane and All
Hallows was an early target of its flames.  British Navy Admiral Sir William
Penn, recently retired to shore duty, oversaw efforts to save the church
from the fire.

Cable Nightclub under Southwark Bridge~
Cable is housed within the atmospheric tunnels under Bridge railway
station, hidden by day behind an unassuming, industrial roll-up door.  The
raw industrial feel of the original viaducts combined with high end sound
and light installations smacks visitors with such a void of culture it
doubles back upon itself; a dark haze of energy clings to the ancient
bricks, flowing through writhing crowds and keeping them in motion 'til
dawn.  The bar cuts a horseshoe shape in the middle of the crowds, serving
drinks and less savory chemicals from a surprisingly complete collection of
narcotics and middle-shelf liquors.  Bass-heavy music pounds at a frantic
rate, thudding out of speakers mounted throughout the tunnel.  The club
doesn't seal its door until the sun rises, letting the addled horde to spill
out into the daylight after a night spent dazed in the tunnels.

King's Cross Station~
Two massive arches of dull brown brick are centered by a moderate clock
tower, iron hands ticking and tocking their way around roman numerals. 
Black-framed panes of glass fill the arches; beneath them gunmetal awnings
direct travelers between two destinations: King's Cross, and the London
Underground.  The latter has collapsed, leaving broken concrete prey to
graffiti.  Stairwells marked by curling designs and bronze letters organize
the approaches to individual platforms.  The homeless huddle in the sticky,
plastic seats provided for passengers in limbo.  Up on Plaform Nine, a
plaque has been installed for literary fans -- "Nine and Three Quarters" in
neatly etched bronze adorns a high brick column, marking the precise opening
to the Hogwarts Express.

The Harrow~
A dark and hazy enclosure formed between two knocked-together Victorian
shops, sequestered away into an alley little wider than a couple walking
shoulder to shoulder, the Harrow suits its namesake with heavy, tined wood
beams and distressed floorboards.  The bar dominates the majority of the
pub, lined with four-legged stools and centuries' worth of scratches, burns
and spills.  What light there is has been provided by a low iron mount
hanging above the foundation line between the two shops; dull yellow bulbs
struggle to pierce the smoky shadows.  The windows are black-framed and
filled with thick glass.  The darkness of the alley pours through them,
seeming to thicken the air inside.

The Ritzy Picturehouse~
The arched opera ceiling is detailed in shades of crimson and goldenrod. 
It descends parallel to rows of red-cushioned theater seating, ending at an
archaic stage and screen that rises two stories, filling the entirety of the
northern wall and edged with dramatic curtains.  Like many cinemas of the
period, it is fitted with an organ.  In 2009, the decor and color scheme was
restored from its original style and a live music venue was added, called
Upstairs.  Access to the upper wings is provided via grand staircases which
hug the walls, open to the reception and ticket lines; open again along the
sides of the theater proper.  Movie showings range from the most modern of
releases to old cult classics on Friday nights.  Popcorn and soft drinks are
sold with chips and curry in the red-carpeted reception.  Posted everywhere
are lit signs for upcoming shows, and notices reminding movie-goers to turn
off their cellphones.

The Old Post Office Bakery~
Bread has always been a communal activity linked to cooperative living;
the sight of an old oven in a back courtyard of some village still gives
rise to images of community, of sharing; on that premise the massive brick
bread ovens are immediately exposed to the eyes upon stepping through the
old black-painted door, rippling waves of nigh-tangible heat into the
delectably scented air.  The Old Post Office Bakery is a fruit grown for
thirty years from the labor, love and loyalty of its local workers;
handcrafted baked goods use staple ingredients without artificial additives.
The breads, cakes, pasties and sausage rolls sold from behind the tarnished
copper counter come wrapped in parchment, prepared precisely as they would
have been in antiquity.  Baskets of hard-crusted baguettes point up at the
low plaster ceilings.  Seating is scarce -- a half-dozen mismatched tables
and armchairs clustered behind the display window.

Upstairs at the Ritzy~
A wide, square loft with warm wood flooring is speckled with tables and
chairs, a single tea candle situated in the center of each table, enclosed
in a red glass holder.  The ceiling is low and the walls composed of modern
windows.  A stage is squished into the corner furthest from the stairwells,
outfitted with whatever equipment is required of the evening's performers'. 
Live music ranges from reggae through afro-beat and vintage swing; folk,
blues, balkan and beyond filter between nights occupied solely by stand-up
comedy.  One entire wall is plastered with posters and notices.  The bar,
solid river rock hauled up from the bank of the Thames, serves beer on tap
and cocktails.

Viajante Restaurant~
Surprise-filled menus combining unconventional ingredients are served
through a petite, monochrome dining room; post-modern lighting curls
delicate black swirls across the high ceiling, suspending red-shades and
circular bulbs that bleed cooling light over iron-legged tables and antique
chairs.  The striking architecture of the former town hall is eerily
accentuated with pieces of modern art; sculptures and wall-hangings dangling
from historic fresco and walnut transom windows.  A padded black leather bar
flanked with low stools runs the width of the south wall, filtered under the
light of flickering, multi-color prisms.  One entire wall, situated to the
right, is decorated solely with the town hall's original light fixtures.  To
the north a pair of ornately carved doors lead out into the arguable
destitution of Bethnal Green.

The old Roman Bath~
With walls formed of layers of brick in that peculiar flat and
neat-looking aspect which implies the impress of Roman hands, the bath has
been written floridly about in countless dialogues spanning centuries of
documentation.  One of the oldest structures in London, one of its few real
and genuine remains dating back to the Roman occupation, the brickwork rises
high into a central arch, plain beyond quaint relics of the Stuart period --
crumbling statuary flanks the sides of the main and ancillary baths, both
frigidly cold and filled solely by rainwater.  Countless gaps in the ceiling
expose the skies over London.  Teenagers and frisky couples make ample use
of the cold waters; the police are known to patrol and check for skinny
dippers.  To the east an unmarked passage leads toward Chancery Lane's
manicured avenue.

Manor at Strawberry Hill~
With its snow-white walls and Gothic turrets, this fantastical and
totally restored 18th-century creation is the work of art historian, author
and politician Horace Walpole.  Studded with elaborate stained glass, the
building reaches its astonishing apogee in here in the gallery, with its
magnificent papier-mache ceiling rising in cathedral arches and walls
painted a matte shade of vermilion.  Keyhole windows line the gallery's
western wall, revealing expansive grounds and well-tended gardens.  The
ornate marble floors are veined with caramel and oft covered with legitimate
Tudor rugs.  Double doors encased in marble capstones stand at the furthest
point of the gallery.  Along the eastern wall elaborate, gilt arches reveal
single doors beneath them.  Gloomy gray staircases wind off to libraries and
private chambers.

A Gray and Periwinkle Bedroom~
Soft periwinkle blue wallpaper pinstriped with silver accents papers the
walls in parchment down to the waist level; from there to the floorboards
cool gray wood is polished to a high shine.  There is a marked absence of
furniture in the room -- a bed wisely dominates the majority of space,
centered in front of a pair of stained glass windows dating back to the
Tudors.  Four high posts of ashen wood reach for the vaulted ceiling. 
Comfortable egyptian cotton sheets are neatly fitted over the expansive
mattress; the coverlet is surprisingly grounded for its surroundings.  A
simple quilt, sewn from countless squares of mismatched, blue-shaded fabric,
drapes across the bed, vanishing at the head under a pile of tidy pillows. 
No closet, armoire or wardrobe is on hand; the one article of furniture
beyond the bed is a small, ash wood table at the bedside.  A half-finished
book is cast across its surface.

Deeds Street~
A narrow street branches steadily yet tersely northward, terminating in a
small cul-de-sac almost immediately.  A block intended to include a
prosperous little shopping circle and park have been abandoned: buildings
sit half-constructed and a few articles of machinery stand rusting and
abandoned.  The absence of artificial light plunges the cul-de-sac into
darkness after nightfall.  Only a single building appears to be
fully-constructed; four-stories tall, base lit by flashing neon signs for a
dubious gentleman's club.  The neon reads "The Puddin' & Pie".

The Puddin' & Pie~
At the base of the stairs leading down from Deeds Street is the small
gentleman's club known as "The Puddin'& Pie."  It is a far cry from its more
illustrious cousins that are dotted around the city of London.  Low ceilings
make the opening room feel tight and cozy.  The opening room has more in
common with a Pub than a club, High tables with stools scattered about and a
large prominent oak bar taking up the majority of the room.  The Bouncer and
the Bartender are both young men who look barely old enough to be in the
building and lightly dressed women serve as waitress' when they are not on
the Main stage.  A pair of large double doors lead off to the main stage and
a tucked in the back close to the bar is a small room.  The neon signs above
denote it as the "VIP Room."

VIP Room at Puddin' & Pie~
Tucked in the back behind the bar is a small room.  For legal reasons the
door doesn't actually click shut, however a handy chair is available if the
door needs to stay shut.  The music of the club is only slightly muffled in
the back room and only dim red lights keep the room from being completely
pitch black.  Along each of the walls is a vinyl covered cushioned bench and
in the center of the room a pole.  The floor is covered in a smooth tile
that looks like it was chosen because it was easy to clean.  The room smells
strongly of perfume and bleach.

A large vaulted ceiling stretches up above the main stage to make the
room feel massive.  The main stage takes up the majority of the room, with
lights pointed to the stage to completely illuminate it.  A set of three
poles are arranged in triangular shape.  Aside from the main stage the room
is only dimly lit by a pale red light.  Along the walls large booths are
shadowed even more than the rest of the room granting privacy.  Only a
single dancer takes the main stage at a time, however there are other women
who stroll around delivering drinks or selling dance tokens.

Deeds Street Flats~
Above the Gentleman's club are what would once have been nice and high
end flats.  While small the building is solidly constructed and blocks the
majority of the sound from the club below.  The main stairwell curls up from
the ground floor to three stories of flats.  Each level of the building
holds four flats, giving the entire building twelve living spaces.  After
the area was abandoned the once nice flats have had to be sold to whoever
would by them.  The Deeds Street Flats are now known as little more than a
crack house.

On the first floor of the Deeds Street Flats is the one belonging to the
owner of the club below.  The small flat is laid out in a very modern design
with a full kitchen complete with washer and dryer.  The Flat is a one
bedroom with an attached bath.  The main room is spacious for its size and
leads out to a small balcony that overlooks the cul-de-sac.  Most of the
house looks very well lived in with clothing, both men and women's scattered
around.  The bedroom walls are plastered completely with a mix of posters
from obscure 70's British punk bands and modern alternative metal bands.

This reclaimed loft opens wide into a welcoming living space.  Floor to
ceiling windows space along the Southern wall to spill rain speckled light
and a fine view of the winding Thames out over the ground floor.  An
abstract painting set along the Eastern wall frames an aged baroque couch
who bends before a low ottoman.  A slim wet room is immediately available to

the Northern half of the space, leading upwards towards an airy mezzanine.

sheets rests.  A study nestles about the top of the staircase where a
crowded bookcase filled to the brim with myriad texts follows the curving
wall while a cluttered desk nestles alongside.  The top of the open stairs
leads downwards from here while a slim portal opens into the master

A Claustrophobic Hedge Thicket~
High stone walls limned in centuries of moss form a narrow enclosure
spanning countless miles; the darkness and tangled mires of thorny branches
overwhelm the boggy mud to the south, while to the north the walls steadily
crumble, lowering little by little, stone by stone, until an opening paved
in ancient cobbles succeeds in battling the thicket for prominence.  The
light of the three moons cast the hedge in shades of bronze and silver,
always full and always brilliant.  Both thorns and walls stretch high enough
to nearly touch them, seeming to sway at their tallest points, grasping for
sharp beams of light.  In the gray stone thousands of pigeon holes house the
croaking, chirruping, moaning echoes of unearthly beasts.

A Crumbling Square Wreathed in Brambles~
The broad square is broken around its edges, crumbling into a muddy crust
of foliage; puddles of sparkling rain water fill the holes in the
cobblestones.  Fantastically huge ruins sprawl out all around, most
prominent in the twin walls that lie to the immediate south, thick with
shadows and veins of palpable glamour.  Moss limns the ancient stones of
falling architecture; eras range from Roman to Victorian, seamlessly
blended, no style appearing any older than the others.  Thorny brambles
crowd through the majority of footpaths and winding streets, leaving them
wholly impassable; to the west and north openings are carved through the
looming hedge, leading through dangerous landscapes and more stony ruins.

A Fallen Tower in a Heavy Grove~
Sitting on its side with the entirety of its lower half submerged under
layers of soil, foliage and crumbled stone, a clock-tower eerily alike Big
Ben ticks and tocks its irregular rhythm through thick silence. 
Phosphorescent light floats through the broken spaces along the tower
proper; will-o'-the-wisps hovering and darting their languorous paths,
tempting onlookers to follow.  Those that do find a swift drop off behind
the tower's structure; a sudden, sharp outcropping that tumbles deeper down
than the eye could perceive.  The occasional cry seems to echo from the
blackness, rising up over the cliff-side and distorting as it ricochets
through the clock-tower's innards.  The tower's spire points directly west,
perhaps inadvertent in its post; a winding footpath follows the line of the
spire, hedged between gently swaying brambles.

A Heavy Thicket of Dark Briars~
The growth is so dense here that the thorns are near impossible to avoid;
tangles of looming, curling, interwoven branches rope wildly over the heaps
of broken marble walls, climbing steadily upward toward the twin moons and
encroaching constantly over the razor thin path that winds south to north. 
In the latter direction the hedge appears to lighten and thin; to the south
a broad square opens, surrounded by crumbling architecture.  Here the
darkness is near complete, making travel a peril and passage intimidating. 
In a black thicket to the immediate west -- a cove formed inside reaching
fingers of thorns and brambles -- a curious ring of massive tree trunks
stand out against the tangle.

The Thorny Ruins of a Bathhouse~
The foundation is all that truly remains of what was once an extravagant
Roman bathhouse; divided into six central chambers, the thorns have
reclaimed what may have never truly stood.  Tendrils of heavy foliage drape
over the one standing wall, situated along the furthest western corner.  A
statue of Mars sits cockeyed upon its head in the crumbling atrium; behind
it the frigidarium's mosaic floor is swept under a thick layer of leaves and
wild fingers of brambles.  Brass braziers curl a haze of intoxicating smoke
along the ledge that still ostensibly leads to the caldarium; in the hottest
chamber, though exposed to the open air and wrought with the encroaching
tangles of hedge greens, steam rises from a pool of marble-edged water.  The
marble is veined with blackened moss, but it's warm to the touch.  To the
east the thorns loom around a narrow path toward a pointing spire.

The London Underground Market~
In London ("under London" may be a better description) the Market is
perpetually in motion, swinging pendulous between the real and the unreal --
a constant quest to the Knights of the Freehold, who are tasked every new
moon with tracking down and solving the puzzle behind the latest entrance. 
The Market of London is in a constant state of motion, wreathed on all four
corners by the tendrils of bridges -- the bridges reach like fingers,
grasping for Gates to connect to, unceremoniously torn away when the Market
deigns to leave.  At it's core the Underground is a dense cluster of Middle
Eastern souks, bright with colorful stalls and scarves, smoky with fumes and
whirls of incense gravitationally drawn toward the statue of a two-headed
horse at the very center.  Fanning out, market squares of traditional
European villages fit together like the pieces of a puzzle, filling miles of
ground.  The outer rings resemble the archetypal image of gypsy camps and
tinkerer's wagons.  The Underground Market is inarguably anachronistic;
wooden stalls, vigorous barkers, hobs and fae in cloaks, tophats, full
medieval or Victorian dress stand cheek-to-jowl with credit card machines
and electronic cash registers.

laws~
#RNo Violence.#n Goblin merchants won't be intimidated, and they won't tolerate 
people trying to injure their customers. Bad for business.
#n
#RYou Get What's Advertised.#n If a merchant tells you that a ten-penny nail has
the power to kill someone when it's driven into its victim's shadow, it has 
that power. It may have other side effects, mind, and the method of death may
be something unexpected and inconvenient -- but you get what's advertised. 
Note, though, that there is no law requiring a merchant to advertise all the
properties or catches to his wares, and there never will be.
#n
#RHonor Your Deals.#n This cuts both ways. A merchant must provide the wares, and
the customer must provide payment. Defaulting on a deal is more than just bad
form (and a potential Clarity hit) -- it riles up the Market, potentially 
against the whole freehold and certainly against the defaulter.
#n
#RNo Refunds.#n If you regret trading away something, you'd better find something
the merchant really wants in order to buy it back -- at an inflated rate, most
likely. That's a brand-new deal.

Topside on the S.S. Serendipity~
Thick steel painted cherry red makes up the topside of this industrial
barge with railings positioned along the outter edge painted white.  The two
colors stand in stark contrast to one another, making their appearance with
the occasional pole rising on the deck topped with floodlights.  Half a
dozen shipping containers rest on the deck in various states of occupation,
rust and wear giving them character.  The topside of the ship is utterly
ordinary, typical as any shipyard inspection could find with a staircase
leading up to the helm and a pair of compartments nearby locked by a pair of
white steel doors leading belowdeck.

lit chamber with anything but the normal affair.  The equivalent of a mess
hall can be found with multiple steel tables spanning the room along with
foldable chairs and a open counter leading back into the ship's kitchen. 
Any other signs of normalcy are forgotten by the time the initial mess is
passed, leading into an open room more akin to a meeting hall than anything
the ship was originally designed for.  Four individual seats can be found,
each one of them luxurious in their own right ranging a gamut of tastes from
an old Victorian wingback to a far too comfortable looking beanbag chair.

Low hanging bulbs cast light on the crew quarters, made larger by the
owner of the vessel to accommodate a far larger crew than the vessel's
original intended.  Dozens of steel framed beds are mounted along the
flooring, stacked in bunks two high to accommodate for space.  One hundred
and fifty count total with clean sheets and two pillows each.  Shelves are
built into the walls along with storage alcoves at the very end of the
quarters with double doors and a pair of locks fastened to them bound with
industrial chain.  Only a handful of the bunks appear to be lived in on a
regular basis with personal effects littering them.

The Drunken Duck~
A single loose brick pushed in and a muttered word summons the sight of a
old stylized wooden door only to disappear to the outside world, hiding all
that can be found within from mortal eyes.  Archaic woodwork opens into a
spacious, cozy, pub with a high ceiling supported by crossbeams of varnished
timber.  Fairy lights dance within polished glass braziers, casting a
comfortable glow on the a dozen tables making up the common room with a
stone hearth visible at its center.  Winter months see a pair of logs
burning for heat though otherwise dormant.  Various framed pictures can be
found on the walls depicting all manner of folk in various states of
merriment, taking different forms to patrons with the sight or mundane if a
bit odd to the rare mortal.  A copper bar runs the length of the wall with a
massive man of few words handling it at all hours of the day and a
television perpetually running BBC or sporting events.

neatly put together and carefully maintained, giving way to only the
occasional crack from decades of use, gives way to a courtyard surrounded by
exquisitely sculpted hedge walls.  The greenery surrounds and gives privacy
to the front walk with a stone three tiered fountain that sprays water in
cascading arcs from the very top to overflow into each of the basins below
it.  Multiple vibrant purple and blue flowers can be found along the walk
surrounding the circular path around the fountain.  The walk ends at a stone
staircase leading up to the front doors of the mansion.

Double doors open to admit entry to the receiving room of the mansion and
its many passages beyond.  Opulent furnishings can be found throughout the
chamber with a crystal chandelier hanging overhead.  Paintings decorate the
walls, ranging from old pieces depicting English countrysides and long dead
heroes of the past while the occasional sculpture or bust accents them. 
Hard wood floors with decorative rugs mark the way within, leading to
hallways that give way to various sitting rooms, dining, and all manner of
chambers both small and grand.  Where gloom might be expected in such a
large, spacious, building, careful lighting and the occasional personal
touch seems to have invaded the mansion with a welcoming air.

Blue wallpaper with floral design covers the spacious walls of the
bedroom without any other adornment to hide them, broken only by a pair of
wall mounted lights surrounding the bed.  The bed is a grand affair with
four posts and dark satin sheets, the threadcount of which could lend
likeness to a cloud for anyone currently occupying them.  A trio of windows
open up along the far wall, framed by curtains matching color with the bed. 
Little in the way of additional furniture can be found save for a chaise
lounge and a man shaped manikin reserved for a long pea coat.  A walk in
closet and entry into a private bath are the only other distinguishing marks
to the chamber.

A Firelit Longhouse~
Timber pillars resting on stones rise to support two long, rafter-bracing
roof beams.  At each pair of pillars the beams are tied together with a
cross beam; descending from the pinnacle of each cross is a shorter pillar
supporting the ridge, and each pillar's foot is carved into tiers of high
and low benches.  The upper rafters form a strong triangular structure; the
lower rafters, hidden behind rustic wainscoting, carry the weight of the
majority of the structure.  Peat moss packed thickly between the rafters
keeps the Hedge's oft-turbulent storms at bay.  Smooth, unfinished wood
comprises the floor, and three distinct chambers branch along the narrow
structure; here the long central hearth rises above the flooring, filled
with smoldering coals and a sizable, smokeless fire.  To the north timber
flanks the opening to another chamber.  To the south, vast doors swing out
into a clearing in brambles.

Lightly tinted cyan glass and weight-monitored sliding doors preface the
entrance to this monstrosity of a shopping hub.  The glowing letters 'ASDA'
arch over the metallic awning at the front entrance, parting open to reveal
age-worn, thoroughly-buffed linoleum flooring.  Unremarkable steel shelves,
racks, and top-lit displays fill the entirety of the building; a row of
check-out lines, depressed cashiers and electronic registers divide the
greater body of labyrinthine aisles from the entrance.  Lime green signs
dangle above each aisle, describing the types of wares contained.  Convex
mirrors reflect the aisles from the far wall, visible to employees, and
sterile, occasionally flickering white fluorescents shine down on shoppers.

Ghost Street~
This narrow, winding road seems almost superimposed over London Wall in
the mortal realm.  Massive buildings line the sides of Ghost street, bearing
surprisingly modern design but made from ancient materials.  The vast
majority of the building's inhabitants are the same 'Ghosts' who are said to
haunt the mad.  A scant few have been cleared by Hobs or Changelings to be
used as save havens; Hollows crop up as often as they can, filling little
hidey holes and larger constructs with a mimicry of life.  The Brierholme
Tower, made of hand hewn stone and reflective modern glass, stands as an
example of the anachronism at play in the London hedge.

Brierholme Towers~
The main lobby of the Brierholme towers is laid out much like the fine
towering hotels of London proper save for a few details.  Floors of crude
cobblestone with invasive weeds creeping up through the cracks and a massive
fountain much like one might discover from an open courtyard dominate the
decor.  Bone dry and showing no signs of recent life, the fountain stands
like a testament to times old amid the modern architecture as if the
building's creators had trampled on its old home.  A broken elevator lies in
ruin with its clockwork mechanisms in pieces, leaving a spiral staircase the
only means to ascend the towering building.  The doors leading out from
lobby on the ground floor are dominated with a shimmering archway, providing
a pathway to the mortal realm for those with the ability to use them or
simply regressing back to the hedge.

The Greenhouse~
The Greenhouse is not just a single floor, but instead several floors
exposed on all sides by reflective glass walls that let the rays of the sun
in, while still providing privacy from the Hedge beyond.  Rows and Rows of
planters, each encased in glass, are laid out across the floors creating a
vast selection of Goblin Fruits.  Intricate ducts and channels create a
pathway for collected rainwater to be channeled down to each of the
planters.  The Common healing fruits grow and bloom by the season.  A few
more exotic varieties each contained with in their own specialized
greenhouses.  The very top floor of the Greenhouse houses large vats used in
the brewing process, as well as kegs and bottles for the finished product.

The Suites at Brierholme~
The top floor of the building is divided out into four sections creating
four Suites above.  The spiral stair case empties out into a large circular
room.  The roof above has caved in and exposes the sky above.  From the hole
the Cistern that holds the collected rainwater for the Greenhouse can be
seen.  At each cardinal point in the circle is a large stone arch with heavy
oak doors.  The Names of the inhabitants glowing on the entrance.

A Tidy Spartan Flat~
This apartment is smallish but well kept, with hardwood floors and beige
walls.  Set up in a mock studio style, there's a kitchenette off to one
side, with some basic and very possibly second hand appliances.  It looks
largely unused, with little in the fridge aside from frozen meals, bottles
of water, and a few scattered containers of condiments.  A futon rather than
a bed has been set up along another wall of the apartment, a dresser nearby
likely housing a wardrobe, and the center of the homely place is dominated
by a shabby but comfortable looking sofa in front of a modestly sized,
slightly out of date television.  The last remaining wall is occupied by a
desk and computer set up, perhaps the most modern looking thing in the room;
not top of the line by any stretch, but above average.

Cal's Suite at Brierholme~
The eastern wing of The Suites bares the name Cal emblazoned on the heavy
wooden door.  Behind it is a wedge shaped room.  The smallest corner of the
curved wedge is the door that extends out to the large rounded windows that
look out of the Hedge.  Inside the room is a functional flat with basic
plumbing and drainage.  A large stone fireplace is the only source of warmth
and also serves as a cooking pit.  A large bed is butted up against the
opposite wall and is covered in a collection of furs and skins of various
hedge beasts.

Geek Chic Main Floor~
There is no denying that this establishment takes its name to heart. 
This nightclub's walls are decorated with artistic renderings of various
geeky pursuits from video games, to movies to depictions of fantasy
monsters, all brilliantly illuminated in vibrant colors.  Similarly colored
chandeliers with draping strands of LED lights hang from the ceiling,
pulsing in time with the music.  Attractive dancers, both male and female in
cosplay outfits dance in cages in various places, suspended over the dance
floor.  At the back is a long bar with a healthy supply of drinks.  A
bouncer stands near a set of stairs leading up to a VIP area, while a built
in arcade is off to the south and to the east the ball pit resides.

Geek Chic Arcade~
No expense was spared on this luxurious arcade and gaming space.  State
of the art VR booths mingle with the latest in arcade cabinets while still
paying homage to classic favorites like pac man and space invaders.  One
wall is dominated by classic pinball.  Upholstered couches and chairs are
set out with more conventional console gaming opportunities.  Headphones are
available for the visitors who want to focus on their games, for the music
from the club filters in from the north.

Geek Chic Ball Pit~
A full Olympic size swimming pool has been converted into a ball pit
filled with multicolored glow-in-the-dark balls.  Playful neon no running
signs are posted on the walls while at the far end there is a lit
lifeguard's stand with an employee watching over the proceedings.  Ropes
dangle from the ceiling so that revelers can swing into the pit.  The same
music that fills the club is pumped into this room through speakers, though
it is at a lower level.

Geek Chic VIP Room~
This section of the club is more fantastical than the rest of the
building.  Careful work has gone into creating a room that seamlessly
combines the decorations with the furniture.  Like out of a fairy tale
forest, roots form comfortable chairs, vines into padded swings.  LED lights
awash in blues and whites and yellows and greens provide illumination as a
starry sky from the arched ceiling.  A faint low fog covers the floor,
pumped in from the walls.  Some modern touches are carefully hidden around
the room, including a television or two as well as speakers providing some
soft house music.

Galley in a Slender Houseboat~
A battered honey wood butcher block fills an excess of space up the
rug-strewn center of the galley.  Behind it the "kitchen" provides minimal,
patched-in opportunity for cooking; an ancient gas range stove hugs wall
across from an open-faced shelf made of copper piping.  Breads, boxes of
cereal and tea tins crowd every available inch of shelf space.  An old,
well-loved sofa with floral cushions and a wicker frame is pushed into the
saloon with a couple small, round pub tables with scarred tops.  Across from
the sofa a laptop and potted fern occupy a long pine counter.  High-angled
windows framed in pine match the wall paneling, though generous portions
have been painted pea green.  A large, creamy white paper lantern hangs from
the middle of the saloon's ceiling.  To the south a wood arch opens into the
stateroom.

A Well-Kept Flat~
Beyond the front door lies the home of someone who likes their space to
be tidy.  Scuffed hardwood flooring stretches out underfoot, complemented by
the sandy beige color painted on the walls; it persists into the kitchen,
joined to the living room with an island bar separating the two.  The
furnishings are simple, old leather covering a plush couch and
cherry-stained wood forming the coffee table and end tables.  A set of large
doors lead out to a short balcony bedecked with living plants, ivy vines
climbing the trellis set against the flat's wall.

A Simply-Furnished Master Suite~
The sandy beige from the living room seeps into the bedroom, though the
flooring has been covered by a white area rug rather than left in its
hardwood state.  Adjoined to the bedroom is the only bathroom in the flat,
kept neutral in hue with a shower and tub, easily accessed by crossing the
floor and opening the door.  A queen-sized bed rests in the center of the
room on a short riser, accompanied by a dresser and shallow closet.  Deeds
Street and surrounding buildings can be seen through the windows.

A Modern London Mansion~
Sleek, modern architecture mark this newer building.  All the decorations
are marked by the bleeding edge of technological progress.  In the large
receiving area a large inclusive entertainment center has been arranged with
multiple large TV screens and a host of stereo and gaming systems arranged
below them.  Several pieces of furniture have keypads built in from which
the climate control, TVs and stereos can be controlled.  Tasteful art
decorates the wall, a mixture of references to Video Games and more classic
art pieces depicting landscapes.  The public areas of the house also
includes a long bar and all of the amenities a person could want.  In
addition to standard locks, powerful magnetic locks secure the doors.

A Landscaped Backyard~
In keeping with the modern style, this backyard is not as expansive as it
could be, yet for London it has quite a bit of space.  Hedges line the yard,
obscuring the privacy fences from the eye.  They have been carefully
sculpted into fantastical shapes with smooth curving lines that add to a
sense of wonder.  Flowers line the paths through the yard as they flow
towards a nearby gazebo and to the water feature that is a functioning set
of tiered swimming pools connected by manmade waterfalls.  Underneath the
awning of the building is a large heated Jacuzzi with a small outdoor bar.

A Large Workshop~
This large workshop is divided into a couple of different sections, each
devoted to a different sort of work.  It runs the gamut from at the near end
a section with a variety of high tech gadgets and computers to the far end
having what looks to be an actual working forge.  The room is heavily
ventilated, so that despite all the work that is done here, the room doesn't
remain dark and smoky.  There is one corner that isn't as obviously devoted
to working, appearing much like a small laboratory with a number of
substances kept under careful lock and key, as is the room its self, hefty
magnetic locks providing security.

A Master Bedroom~
The walls of this room are almost entirely covered with posters depicting
various gaming and movie icons.  Where they aren't covered is the large TV
that is situated across from the foot of the large, silk covered bed with a
number of gaming systems hooked up to it.  Discreet speakers are located in
the corners of the room, hooked both into the TV and to the desktop computer
that is situated against the eastern end of the room.  The computer looks to
be at the cutting edge and is often open to show feeds from the security
cameras located around the estate.
