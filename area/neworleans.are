man~
Topping around six foot seven this man towers over the majority of other
people.  He is thickly set with muscle on a substantial frame, sandy haired
and brown eyed.  Light crows feet and a few laugh lines wrinkle a face that
is probably in its early forties.  A layer of stubble forms a five o'clock
shadow.  His leather jacket is zipped halfway up his firm abdomen and looks
like the kind of garment that's more a friend than a fashion statement.  A
white tee shirt is worn beneath, and plain blue jeans with thick black boots
below.  He stands outside the door to Vaughn's with a cigarette through the
bar's open hours and decides who goes in and who does not.

#pThe card is made from thick scroll paper that has been shaped around

front; one in pink paint, one red, one white.  Though the maker tried for
elegance, it's the sort of thing a slightly advanced gradeschooler would
make if they had all the time and supplies in the world.  There is a bit of
glitter dusting the inside, where "Happy Valentines Day" is written in pen,
signed "With Love, Marie."  #n

#ROOM_V1
#16700
#eMons Venus#r Jazz Club#e (#rAvg. NPCs: 152#e)#n~
Trademark brothel-red dim table lamps provide the sole light in this
sultry jazz club, the walls composed of chipped reddish grey brick in thin
layers that absorb the all-encompassing, often riotous sound of the expertly
played brass, string and percussion instruments, wielded by artistic hands
of the house band.  The music is never-ending, and the waitresses that drift
about the room, circular cork-topped trays supported by one hand often
filled with drink orders, have adapted to using facial expressions and hand
language to communicate with customers, rather than speech.  The club is
bustling full at all hours of the night; depending on the speed and tone of
the jazz melding out from the upraised stage at the far end, opposite the
bar, there could be couples dancing with surprising, cultured skill, or
people just sitting round their tables, drinking and sending their own
clouds of greying smoke into the atmosphere to join the everpresent haze. 
The bar snakes along the western wall, manned by an older Creole in a
pressed black collared shirt; the uniform for the establishment, apparantly,
as the waitresses - and even the band - have donned the same.  In red and
black neon cursive lettering across the upper enclosure of the stage reads
'Mons Venus,' suggesting both the name of the club, and the group of
musicians themselves.  The floor is a solid, black-varnished wood with a
polished shine.

`rCourtyard of Hermann-Grima House`n~
A wide, circular driveway leads the way to one of the most significant
houses in New Orleans, sweeping around a subtly-lit, tiered stone fountain. 
The gentle sounds of the rushing water somewhat drown out the din of nearby
Bourbon Street, soothing to the ears.  Well kept lawns extend to the outer
walls of the property, unadorned yet elegant in their simplicity.  To the
south, a set of pristine marble stairs lead upward to the modest porch, the
intimidating double doors bearing the same symbol within their meticulously
carved glass panes as the majestic gates.  Similar, though less grand, doors
on the upper floor directly above lead out to a balcony which extends the
entire width of the building, overlooking the courtyard and gates, boasting
expertly wrought iron railings.

`rHermann-Grima House - Central Hall`n~
The wide central hall doubles as a reception area even in current times,
a few well padded armchairs placed against the walls between the numerous
doorways that lead elsewhere in the house.  Carpeted in a rich burgundy and
gold, the walls a soft buttery hue from floor to the ceiling high overhead,
the dark, obviously antique furniture contrasts pleasantly with it's
surroundings.  A dark sideboard against the eastern wall holds numerous
candleabra's, adding a quiet atmosphere, a small mahogany serving table
opposite bearing several business cards on it's white marble top.  Beyond
the curving staircase to the south, an arching, glass panelled backdoor
likely leads to the gallery and gardens, while open doors inside seem to
allow free reign throughout the grand domain.

`rHermann-Grima House - Parlor`n~
A warm and inviting palette entices bodies into this indulgently
decorated room.  Of the same candlelight hue of the hallway, the walls here
are made more vibrant by the rich, draping fabrics of the heavy curtains and
furnishings.  Couches and chairs of polished dark wood bear plush cushions
of orange and crimson lend a certai vivacity to the area,as do the stunning
rugs laid atop the original wooden floorboards.  Lit mostly by ivory
candles, the parlor reeks of old world class, still containing the grand
fireplace and pianoforte.  Several oil paintings decorate each wall,
portraits of previous owners and notable figures in Louisiana Society
through the centuries.  Four glass walled cabinets are evenly spaced along
the eastern wall, displaying several different sets of armor; a full set of
chainmail, covered by a faded white tabard with a red cross, it's arms
brought forward to rest heavy gauntlets atop the sword that stands on it's
point between the mannequin's feet, a distinctive dark blue, red trimmed
uniform of the Continental army, including a musket and an ornate pistol, a
dark grey military uniform, bearing an armband of bright red, adorned with a
swastika, a grenade held in the mannequin's hand, a rueger pistol on it's
belt.  The final cabinet holds the distinctive pale grey and gold jacket of
the Confederate Army during the Civil war, a cavalry sabre and a revolver
clutched in the mannequin's hands.

`rHermann-Grima House - Gallery`n~
The high, blue painted arching doorway of the main house leads out here
into the stunning night gardens of the stately home.  Paved pathways meander
through the well tended flowerbeds and thriving foliage, leading to the
outbuildings at the eastern side.  Though far less grand than the house
itself, they remain in good order, a large, arching doorway opening inward
to room of moderate size.  The second floor boasts a modest balcony, running
the length of the long structure, overlooking the grounds.  Once the stables
and slave quarters, they have been converted recently, though still house
the traditional outdoor kitchen.  To the south, the gardens extend in a
gently downward-sloping lawn.

`rHermann-Grima House - Boardroom`n~
Once the luxurious dining room of the stately home, this has now been
converted to a meeting room of sorts.  Though the original parquet flooring,
decor and chandelier remain, all unnecessary furnishings appear to have been
removed, leaving only an immense oak table that spans a considerable area. 
The chairs that surround it seem a little more modern, upholstered in a
gleaming black leather, a dozen of them in total circling.  The glittering
illumination of the chandelier overhead reflects dully in the table's
polished surface.  In keeping with the neighbouring rooms, the walls are a
soft candlelight shade, the heavy drapes guarding the windows a resplendent
crimson.  The room seems to cling to an air of anticipation.

`rHermann-Grima House - Upper Hallway`n~
Rising up from the stairs and hallway below, this hall is decorated in a
smilar manner; walls of a soft buttery hue and a luxurious crimson and gold
carpet.  Plush armchairs of similarly hued upholstery and gilt details are
scattered apparently at random along the walls, one resting alongside an
ornate mahogany bureau.  Atop this stands a tall candleabra, casting a
gentle illumination across the oil painting mounted above.  Rising from
perhaps halway up the stairs, beginning at the curve toward the upper
landing, a stained glass window is set into the wall, the dark hues allowing
next to no light through and it's details nigh impossible to make out.  Dark
panelled doors lead off to east and west, while the hallway continues to the
north.

`rAn open-air kitchen`n~
Though simple in layout and decor, this traditional kitchen is evidently
still in use and well cared for.  The enormous, original fireplace dominates
the northern wall, unlit for now.  The wrought iron swinging crane still
remains, bearing a few pots over the scattered ashes in the hearth.  Sturdy
wooden shelves line the wall to either side, bearing all manner of goods and
a large table, it's surface marred by years of wear and tear, is placed
centrally upon the tiled floor.  Againt the western wall by the door stands
a waist-high potager, wood neatly stacked in the lower right segment, three
of the four stewholes dusted with ash from recent use.  A simple tin kettle
rests atop one.  Flanking the northern doorway on it's other side is a
simple beehive oven, the kind typically used on plantations.  Several
wrought iron utensils are leaned neaty against it's flue.  To the east, an
open doorway leads to a dimly lit corridor.

evening.  A traditional kitchen lies beyond the western doorway, while
another archway leads northward.  The corridor continues to the south,
illuminated by bare, hanging bulbs overhead.

Once the stables of the stately home, the wooden divisions and gutters of
the stalls still exist, though this area is now obviously used for storage. 
Rickety old furniture, boxes of ornaments and old lamps and a number of
sealed crates are all neatly stacked, leaving the main cobbled corridor
clear.  A large archway in the western wall looks out upon the expansive
lawns, the remaining flagstones outside slowly succumbing to the grass.

Left largely unadorned, these expansive lawns slope gently upward toward
the rear of the house, flanked on the eastern side by the outbuildings and
overlooked by the main gallery and upper balcony.  Though the distant sounds
of late-night revellers on Bourbon Street are distinguishable, the gardens
remain a peaceful spot to enjoy a stroll.

Sturdy wooden shelving lines the walls of this room, offering spaces of
varying size, in which are folded and hung numerous garments.  A simple
fireplace against the far western wall is evidently used to heat the
traditional irons but for the moment remains unlit.  A smooth wooden table
rests a few feet before it, an elegant shirt of off-white silk currently
laid out across it's surface.  The pleasant, warm scent of laundry fills the
room, which boasts the same tiled flooring as the hall beyond.

Small but efficient in design, these quarters retain the original

Several modest beds are set around the room and a small curtained window
within the western wall likely overlooks the gardens.  A worn rug covers the
center of the floor, it's pattern no longer distinguishable.

of the property.

`rHermann-Grima House - Office`n~
Surprisingly scarce of embellishment in comparison to the rest of the
stately home, this well-appointed office nevertheless conveys a strong sense
of individuality, combined with a touch of the old world.  The eastern wall
is taken up entirely by the enormous media center, the focus of the subtly
ornate unit being an enormous, flat-screen television, aligned directly
behind and a little above the high backed leather chair that accompanies the
desk.  Clearly antique but in near-perfect condition, the immense desk is
almost six feet in length, and bears several draws either side of the
seating alcove, each with a gleaming gold handle.  The surface itself is the
traditional forest green hue, bordered by the dark, inlaid wood that the
desk is carved from.  The thick carpet underfoot is of a sombre, misty grey
hue, though it's shade is warmed a little by the chic peacock-blue of the
walls.  Sleek, heavily-lined curtains of countless layers, ranging from
creamy musline to charcoal velvet, cover the tall french windows, leading
southward toward the balcony.  A sparkling chandelier overhead casts it's
glow over the furnishings beneath, including the two plush ivory-upholstered
armchairs set before the desk in an expectant manner.

`rHermann-Grima House - An opulent bathroom`n~
Stunningly tiled with gleaming marble floors of a emerald shade, this
luxurious bathroom simply oozes class.  A roman bath is set perhaps two feet
below floor level, adorned with traditional brass fittings.  Entirely
covered by well polished mirrors, the northern wall reflects the subtle
lighting of the medium-sized crystal-drop chandelier overhead.  The other
walls clash elegantly with the decor; an intricate Edwardian pattern in
textured gold, in comparison to the thick, black velvet curtains that take
up much of the southern wall.  These evidently look out to the balcony, via
the tall french windows beyond.

leatherbound volumes of every hue imaginable, this high-ceiling room has a
peaceful, contemplative air about it.  Within the eastern wall stands the
original fireplace, which, going by the wood pile on the hearth, is still
functional and often used.  Above the beautifully carved mantle several
ancient looking pieces are framed and hung; scraps of parchment bearing
flowing script, the scrap of a Confederate flag, pages from books likely
long forgotten and the remnants of some sort of banner, it's embroidery
jaded and worn with the passage of time.  A soft couch, upholstered in gold
and cream and scattered with cushions, rests before the fire, an ideal place
for reading, while behind it is placed a heavy table, scattered with open
books and scribbled notes.

`rHermann-Grima House - Master Bedroom`n~
Seductive and luxurious are two words that might describe this enormous
bedroom.  Boasting little furniture save for the immense, wood-carved four
poster, draped in shimmering, sheer fabric and a few plush amrchairs, it
relies largely upon it's decor for the breathtaking effect.  A large
fireplace adorns the western wall opposite the door, it's mantle decorated
with various sculptures and other ornaments, as well as a vast, very old
looking painting, framed in gold on the wall above.  It depicts an oddly
melancholy scene; a crumbling keep upon a rugged hill, caught in a heavy
storm.  Apparently no longer in use, the hearth itself is filled with an
array of ivory candles, casting the warm light of a fireplace across the
room.  Indeed, no other light source is apparent, the ceiling bearing only
an extensive, beautifully painted mural, apparently depicting some great
ancient battle.  The original creamy moulding of the house borders it,
leading the eye downward to the deep crimson hue of the walls, a subtle
damask effect adding texture to the chosen color.  The deep pile carpet
underfoot is of a golden-ivory shade that complements the dark wood of the
bed and sparse furnishings.  Heavy drapes cover the tall windows in the
northern wall, crafted of a soft burgundy velvet.

`rHermann-Grima House - Simple Balcony`n~
Running the length of the front of the property, this balcony overlooks
the front lawns and main gates.  Adorned only with the ornate wrought-iron
railing that encloses it and the arching french doors leading northward into
the upper hall, it seems rather spartan and rarely used.

#oInside a spacious warehouse#n~
This huge space seems to be a large warehouse, the ceiling is very high
and the walls seems to be made out of very strong brick.  Lights hang from
the ceiling, there are twelve in all, giving off a nice bright atmosphere. 
The bar is situated towards the right hand side.  It is long and made out of
hard maple wood, a miror is behind it, and pictures of presidents are stuck
on the wall behind them.  Tables are scattered arund the place messily, the
whole place looks like a club for a biker gang of some sorts.  There is a
pool table to the left.  There is one bathroom at the back, in the middle
back wall.

This room seems to be in a total state of ruin, the walls seems to be
flimsy, and stains of several colours are on the floor.  There is a cheaply
made bed in the middle of the room.  There is only one window and reinforced
bars cover the window.  Light comes from the single lightbulb hanging from
the ceiling.

#oAn upwinding Staircase#n~
This staircase of metal and wooden boards seems to be sturdy.  It goes up
and then takes a sharp left.  Below, the ongoings of the bar and the pool
table can be seen clearly.  To the end of the staircase, there is a old
wooden door most likely leading into a private room.

#oA private room#n~
This room seems to be small in comparison to the lower floor.  It doubles
up as sleeping quarters and an office.  Immediately, as one can see, there
is a desk with wooden chairs placed on one side of the room.  The desk is
made out of cheap wood with drawers on the owner's side.  The bed is
siutated on the far right of the room.  There seems to be no divider to
divide the small office and sleeping area.  There is also a small balcony
leading out from this room from which one can stand and watch the street
outside.

#CTchoupitoulas Street#n~
The mournful sound of a ship horn echoes around the brick buildings
lining either side of this dimly lit street.  Cars and people aren't
frequent in this area, but still can be seen driving or walking through from
time to time.  The bright lights and noise of the calle de bourbon have been
left behind in this place of older and mostly commercial brick buildings. 
Cramped between a pair of brick buildings sits a tiny, dilapidated pumping
station.  A long, simple sign, reading `rCentral Autoworks`n, hangs over a
massive garage door, dwarfing a smaller, pedestrian door to the left. 
Another iteration of the shop's name is painted on the garage door,
supported by a motto, in cursive, below: "Service with a Smile!"

#CTchoupitoulas Street#n~
Narrow and dim, these older streets of the city are crowded with three
and four story buildings of white, pink and gray brick.  Most of them now in
various states of decay, they are used for more mechanical or industrial
type businesses or are abandoned altogether.  Some house rental storage or
commercial storage areas.  This isn't an area many tourists would come to
visit, particular in the evening or night hours.

To the south, spanning two stories of weather-worn, wild jasmine and
lavender vine overgrown brick is a huge building, built in a U-shape with
two towers that reach three stories on each corner.  Double glass doors
severely caked with grime and mold with old wheel-chair capable ramps and a
huge vantage point with 'Pleasant Hills Psychiatric' written upon an
overhanging sign lead into the building to the south.  The remains of a
large, but rather unobtrusive brick warehouse lies north, little more than
rubble and ash.

#GTraveling East Along I-10#n~
From large 18-wheeler trucks to compact cars, every style of vehicle, old
and new goes whizzing by all hours on this busy section of Interstate.  Six
lanes of traffic flowing back and forth as New Orleanians go about their
business.  The smell of exhaust is heavy here, and the noise level high.  An
off ramp leads a trickle of heavy semi-trucks, gas tankers and the
occasional normal normal vehicle into an oval shaped parking lot with a
round-about.  The lot is paved with old, cracked cement and at the very
center is a massive glowing neon sign that would have been perfectly
appropriate in the 1950s, reading #RHarvelle's#n in disjointed script, the
'f' in Cafe having stopped working long ago.

The interstate veers off to the left, taking a loop turn down to a large
road leading to a huge construction site looming in the horizon.  A winding
exit that demands a thiry-five mile per hour speed twists off to the south,
ending in a vast parking lot.

#GUpon the Lake Front#n~
The hard paved road, just wide enough for two cars to pass side by side, 
curves along the tree speckled lake front leaving the hustle and bustle of 
New Orleans proper behind. The wind stirred murky waters of the lake brush 
onto the pebbled shore, the repetitive nature smoothing the edges of the 
stones, the occasional leaf or twig finding a home among them. Tall cypress, 
sturdy oaks draped in Spanish moss, and the occasional sweetgum and hackberry 
saplings play hide and seek providing brief glimpse of the water that lay 
beyond as the lakeshore road extend further along into the distance. Murky 
waters provide cover for deep sucking mud that lays in wait just under the 
surface, catching and holding any who set foot down, dotted with forgotten 
stumps and heavy rocks. The chirp of crickets joins the natural ecosystem 
about the lake, home to many elusive creatures, the area giving chances to 
catch a glimpse of the foxes, deer, wild turkeys, and swamp rabbits. Wild, 
untended azaleas, magnolias, camellias and crepe myrtles fill the landscape 
with vivid dots of color and a heady scent should the wind blow just right. A 
natural cropping of large flat rocks jut out in a point spearing a few feet 
out into the water offering a perfect resting place to sit and reflect in the 
quiet calm of the surroundings.

looks to be in somewhat of a tidy order, nothing just laying about.  A
television is set up within a entertainment center, surrounded by cd's. 
Along the side of the room is the kitchen not seperated by any way.  The
only means of looking out of this apartment is a window, which is covered by
a few thick heavy curtains.  And the only door is to the bathroom.

`cMain Studio`n~
The ceiling in this  room is canted on either side, a strip in the 
middle a few feet wide being the only vertical section.  The walls 
themselves  also curve, lending the whole room a tent-like look. A 
hanging lamp  descends from the center of the ceiling, casting its 
glow onto the highly polished  pinewood floor. The room as a whole 
is spartanly furnished;  in  the right hand corner is a futon-like
sofa, flush against the wall. An acoustic sound barrier is against 
the  far  wall,  keeping  the  noise of both the neighbors and the 
occupant to a minimum. The left hand wall has two skylight windows 
in  it's upper  half, and against  the wall itself is a tiny table 
with  two matching chairs. Sat  reverently in a corner is a guitar
case and several  matching journals, all in various conditions and
of various  apparant ages. The walls are a light offwhite, and the 
paneling matches the pinewood floor.

`cA Small Bedroom`n~
Simple pieces  of light, teak bedroom furniture have been carefully 
placed  around  this  dimly  lit  room. A twin bed lined with white 
cotton sheets rises from the floor atop an unadorned frame, and has 
been made up neatly with a  single down-stuffed blanket and pair of
soft pillows. The hardwood floor  is  obviously  well taken care of 
but shows tell-tale signs of the wear and  tear  typically  present 
in decrepit  old buildings. The only window is on the wall opposite
the door, and  it has been sealed closed with bars for security and
several  layers  of  white  curtains  that  prevent  any light from 
coming in when drawn. A  fouton  sofa with a wood frame and worn-in
cushion  sits  beside  an old  fashioned radio on a tiny end table.
A  small,  particle-board  bookshelf  with a black and white framed 
picture  upon it and  a  dresser  with  a  couple  of  the  drawers 
permanently ajar are the only other objects of note.

`eFoyer of a Plantation House`n~
The stone walls of this massive foyer have been covered in fine, if not
time worn, rosewood paneling.  Framed mirrors rise to the ceiling, spaced
out by three foot margins that contain painted men and women within dark
frames staring out at passerby.  Figures from all ages there are - bedouins,
Eygptians, then Greeks and Romans, and knights in armor, and peasanta and
kings and queens.  There are Renaissance people in doublets and leggings,
the Sun King with his massive mane of curls, and finally people of modern
days and nights.  The details are immense and make the onlooker nearly
believe that they imagined them - the droplets of water clinging to a cape,
the cut on the side of a face, the spider half-crushed beneath a polished
leather boot.  The singing of birds and the perfume of flowers is a near
tangible force within the foyer, and it is not difficult to lose ones self
within the sea of cages that fill an entire portion.  There are not only
birds of all sizes and colors, but monkeys and baboons, all of them going
wild in their little prisons around the room.  Potted plants crowd against
the cages, ferns and banana trees, cabbage roses, moonflower, jasmine, and
other sweetly fragrant nighttime vines.  There are purple and white orchids,
waxed flowers that trap insects within their maws, little trees groaning
with peaches and lemons and pears.  Severely aged suits of old armor telling
tale of ancestors who fought in noble wars since the times of the Crusades
with St.  Louis are arranged on racks, and hung on the walls above all the
rest of the clattering metal are a good many lances, battleaxes, flails and
maces.  A gigantic insignia has been etched, filigreed and hammered into
beautiful design at the peak of the ceiling, that of a rosewood handled
broadsword with a dragon curled around the blade.

#oA Living Room#n~
The living room is also rather plain, feeling very much like the rest of
the house in its simplicity, yet ease of use.  The soft cream carpet is kept
in a state of rather immaculate cleanliness, either from constant attention,
or perhaps rather lack of use.  The latter seems to be the case, as a fine
layer of dust covers everything, looking as if almost not being disturbed
for some days.  A rather large leather sofa is one of the few pieces of
furniture, save a 30 inch television and entertainment center.

`eLibrary and Study`n~
Walls and walls of books and rolled manuscripts, giant glistening world
globes in wooden cradles, busts of ancient Greek gods and goddesses, and
great sprawling maps fill this horrendously large room past a narrow
Parisian archway that leads in from the south.  Newspapers in all languages
lay in stacks on tables, and everywhere there are strewn curious objects;
fossils, mummified hands, exotic shells, bouquets of dried flowers,
figurines and fragments of old scripture, and alabaster jars covered with
Egyptian hieroglyphs.  Everywhere in the center of the room, scattered among
the tables and the glass cases, are comfortable chairs with footstools, and
candleabras or oil lamps.  The impression of the library as a whole is that
of comfortable messiness, of great long hours of pure enjoyment, a place
that is human in the extreme - Human knowledge, human artifacts, chairs in
which humans might sit.  The stone walls not lined by shelves to house tomes
have been covered in fine rosewood paneling with framed mirrors rising to
the ceiling.  There are painted chests, upholstered chairs, dark and lush
landscapes, porcelain clocks, and a small collection of specifically set
apart literature in a glass-doored bookcase.  High narrow French doors open
onto a stone terrace, where banks of white lilies and red roses give off
their powerful perfume.

The entryway to this modest home is rather plain.  A few pairs of shoes
are littered around just inside the door, very near the step which leads up
into the living room which can be partially seen from the entryway.  The
carpet here is a dirty brown, stained from tracked in mud.

A large four poster bed dominates the room here, made of oak and maple. 
The dark wood contrasts perfectly to the cream carpet of the room.  Blue
sheets can be seen from the unkempt bed, a dark green comforter covering it.
A simple translucent drape hangs from the bed, partially obscuring the view
within.

`eA Damp Alleyway Before an Apartment Complex `n(`eAvg. NPCs: 1`n)~
This is a small opening perhaps six feet wide and twenty feet deep,
filled with nothing but the darkness and damp, surrounded on all sides by
brick.  This alleyway seems to gather the majority of moisture from the air,
sucking away the humidity throughout the day as the sun causes it to
evaporate from the street to the north.  The ground has an inch of viscous,
filthy water upon it.  To the south is a dilapadated apartment building with
three stories.

#eA Small Private Cemetery#n~
Black iron encloses this small, private cemetery.  Angelic stone statues
guard the winding pathway to the cemetery from the plantation home, their
eyes watching every footfall as though they might spring to motion at any
moment.  A few stone grave markers rest in parallel lines just a short
distance from the entrance, while several larger, more elaborate tombs sit
towards the back with large ornate crosses distinguishing them from the
rest.  The life of the nearby stagnant bayou sends out its haunting whispers
that carry to the cemetery on the night air.  Freshly turned dirt, stacked
up several feet lays just beside a newly dug plot near the far reach of the
cemetary gate.  The vast majority of the grave markers hold titles and the
surname of Estienne, most especially those larger more elaborate tombs in
the back.

#rSecond Floor of An Apartment Complex#n~
This is a normal entrance hall to a normal looking apartment complex. 
White tile, locked door, and rows of tenant mailboxes.  A speaker system
where visitors could be buzzed in if need be.  A set of rounded iron-railed
stairs head to the floors above.

`eGallery and Sitting Room`n~
Mounted lamps ensconced in thick, old glass have been lighted throughout
this massive, angular room, casting warm yellow light through the narrow and
open archways.  The windows are uncovered and they look out over the
firmament and the old indigo fields.  Magnificent Grecian urns stand on
pedastals in the corridors, great bronze statues from the Orient in their
various niches, exquisite plants bloom at every window and terraces open to
the sky.  Gorgeous rugs from India, Persia, and China cover the coarse wood
floors.  There are giant stuffed beasts mounted in lifelike attitudes - the
brown bear, the lion, the tiger and even the elephant standing in his own
immense personal chamber, lizards as big as dragons, birds of prey clutching
dried branches made to look like the limbs of real trees.  But no matter of
anything else of beauty in the room, the brilliantly colored murals covering
every surface from floor to ceiling dominate all.  Covering one wall is a
dark vibrant painting of the sunburnt Arabian desert complete with an
exquisitely detailed caravan of camels and turbaned merchants moving over
the sand.  Across another wall a jungle comes to life around the onlooker,
swarming with delicately rendered tropical blossoms, vines, and carefully
drawn leaves.  The perfection of the illusion is startling , and the more a
person looks the more they see can by means of detail.  As for the style of
the paintings, it is left much to guesswork.  The technique is utterly
realistic, using the classical proportions and skills one sees in all the
later Renaissance painters: da Vinci, Raphael, Michelangelo, as well as the
painters of more recent times, Wateau, Fragonard.  The use of light is
spectacular.  Living creatures seem to breathe within the vibrant artistry. 
The details are the only thing to strike one as odd, as upon intent
investigation, it must be discerned that they are not realistic or in
proportion.  There are simply too many monkeys in the jungle, too many bugs
crawling on the leaves.  There are thousands of tiny insects in one painting
of a summer sky.  Plush French furnishings, chairs, couches and other such
items, are arranged haphazardly wherever there is room within this massive
space.

`oA Dusty Living Room`n~
The room is fairly large with dark wood flooring.  The whole place smell
faintly of dust and cedar.  Yellowing paisley wallpaper with soft faded
designs covers all four walls and matches the two cushions on the brown
couch.  A large framed picture decorates one of the walls, a portrait of a
busy New York avenue sometime in the late 1800s.  Just below that is a 25
inch television, silent in black and white, on a rolling cart.  One solitary
stained glass lamp swings from the ceiling with the fan attached to it,
making the room cool and filling it with eerie dusty light.  A set of deep
red floor runners decorate the room, one in front of the couch the other
leading down a dark hallway.

`oA Dreary Studio`n~
A strange smell of old paint and pencil lead fills this room, slowly
being filtered out by the one small window.  The breeze is only notices
because of the fluttering of thick black curtains.  There is a large tarp
folded in the corner, half tucked under a red tool box filled with art
supplies.  A large mirror complete with stand rolls along to where its
needed.  While a metallic desk and artists table in front of the window dont
seem to be going anywhere.  A little plug sits lonely on the shiny steel of
the desk just waiting to be used.  Another stained glass lamp hangs from the
ceiling offering a modest light to the place, brighter then the rest of the
rooms.

`bA Dark Hallway`n~
In this cramped hallway the red floor runner ends abruptly as the glow
from the living room disappears.  The wall paper hasn't changed much, the
patterns in the yellow texture becoming stranger somehow though nothing has
changed, save the lack of light here.  A door lies to your right the handle
almost invisible and another down the hall, light peeking out from the gap
between the door and the floor.

`oA Dismal Bedroom`n~
The yellow wallpaper returns in this room, covering all four walls.  In
the middle of the space is a full sized bed covered in green and blue
patterned sheets.  The wood of the flooring doesnt match at all with the red
of head board of the bed, but from what the rest of the decorations have
been like it seems unlikely the owner cares.  Blue black gauzy material
drops down from the four posters pulling the wrinkled covers into shadow. 
The rest of the rooms seems pretty sparse, there is a half filled book self
and a vacant night stand.  An open window equipped with a strong latch lock
similar to the ones seen on the other windows , ushering air into the room
though another set of ink black curtains.  Oh and a lava lamp, its green
light casting the room into viridian shadow.

`g-`G-`gMain Room`G-`g-`n~
As you enter this room, the mood of New Orleans is instantly swept away
from all senses.  The sounds of a Japanese Biwagaku meet the ears, the
four-stringed instrument plucking away in a beautiful chorus of culture ripe
enough to meditate to.  These sounds most likely come from some crappy boom
box hidden somewhere.  The floor is done up in brown-red carpet, and in the
middle of the room there is a Maru coffee table(a low, oriental table that
you sit on your knees at.)  The table is painted the same color as the
carpet, and lining the outsides of the table are small glass Sake cups.  To
the far right wall, there is a wooden stand, most of the holders empty
except for the middle one, which holds a lone katana.  To the right is a
tall Kuryo bookcase, with some assorted novels written in Japanese text, and
on the top most shelves are a collection of lit inscents, which burn slowly
the smells of lavender and other natural scents.  Aside from these things,
the living room floor is completely empty, allowing for much sitting room,
although there is no furniture and no T.  V.  Farther into the room as a
small kitchen, which contains only a small stove, an equally small
refrigerator, and a large wooden Mizuya cabinet.  All in all, it would seem
that the theme of this room is undoubtedly Japanese.  On the left wall is a
wooden door leading west.

`g-`G-`gSparring Room`G-`g-`n~
The floor of this room is completely covered in a straw sparring mat. 
The room is quite large, and lining the walls are various stands with an
assortment of Martial Arts implements.  Wooden nunchucks, bokkens, take-bo,
and other random practice weaponry that would seem to come straight from a
Chuck Norris film, although they seem to be quite authentic.  At the far end
of the room is a large Mizuya wardrobe closet slid up against the wall. 
This most likely contains whatever uniforms the owner desires to wear.  Most
likely a set of Kimono.

`eJust Before a Large Plantation House`n~
A lavish water fountain is the center of attention in this small circle
turnabout' just before the plantation house.  The cypress trees continue to
block out most of the light, causing darkness to fill the area due to no
artificial lights being used outside the house, and draping with gauzy, dark
Spanish moss.  Just to the west, a private cemetery is blocked off by a black 
iron fence.  The plantation house looms directly to the north, the steps 
leading to the front porch enticing people to come forward; large, faded white 
columns line the front of the classic scenic porch.  There is even a wooden 
rocking chair and porch swing that give the plantation home a more Southern 
look.  A lone lantern hangs just next to the front door offering the only 
light under the darkness of the cypress trees.

#rA Small Apartment#n~
A rather spare, spartan room of the sort one might expect from a college
student.  The couch placed before the small plasma screen television is a
hand-me-down affair.  Overstuffed and sporting an antique flower patterned
weave, it's clearly beginning to age, seams fraying into loose threads and
odd dents in the cushions from long use.  Comfortable as an old shoe.  The
carpeting is a soft off white.  Instead of a coffee table, there is a simple
affair of electronics placed haphazardly on the floor before the
entertainment center.  PS3, PS2, X-box, Super Nintendo, Gamecube, and even a
classic Atari console are all spread out with their wires crisscrossing in
enigmatic wildness like a mess of veins within a cadaver.  A bookshelf near
the door contains a rather random assortment of books, including everything
from Piers Anthony to philosophy textbooks.  A recliner is positioned before
the television, beside the couch, a small wooden table at it's arm upon
which an empty bottle of Jones Soda sits quiescently amidst an empty ashtray
and empty chewing gum wrappers.  Either in this room or the attached,
economical kitchen there exists little purposeful decoration, save the
detritus of opened letters, discarded shirts, and the general flotsam and
jetsom of a young bachelor.  A large window is in the side wall, leading to
the outside, obscured by a heavy black wool curtain.

#rA Small Apartment Bedroom#n~
This room is smaller, cozier, sharing in the same personal character of
it's owner.  Boxes of books are placed against the wall beside a light
wooden desk of the modern style, cheap, easily assembled, and easily
disassembled.  A spotlight style black lamp sits on the top of the
scratched, worn wood, pointed down at am old ntoebook.  Mechanical pencils
litter the surface, along with small erasers, open study books, and a greasy
plate with a few crumbs from last night's pizza pocket.  A microwave is
tucked into the corner, a minifridge beside it sporting a selection of Jones
Soda, Rockstar energy drink, and a bottle of unopened pinot noir.  A closet
is set into the wall near the door, a clothes hamper lying almsot neglected
nearby, clothes scattered around it from inexpert tosses.  The futon is
quite neat and well kept, in distinct contrast to the rest of the room,
which manages to be neat only due to the lack of a greater amount of
material possession with which to clutter it.  A large, heavy wooden chest
is pushed up into the closet.

#rApartment J Living Area#n~
Decorated in a mishmash of used furniture, this small and immaculate loft
is dimly lit by an ambient light emitted by various pot lights and ceiling
lamps.  This main room is split into two sections by a single step, dividing
the room into an upper and lower level.  The lower half features the
entranceway, kitchen and bathroom, while the upper half consists of a living
area and a large staircase.  The lower half, with the kitchen area as its
main feature, is painted a dark red with cocoa faux finish.  The light makes
the walls seem to glow against the mustard yellow appliances and counters. 
In contrast to the garish appliances, some small chrome counter items like a
toaster and blender, free of any dirt or crumbs.  The upper half of the
room, featuring the living room and staircase, has a polished wooden floor
and light camel colored walls covered with colorful cartoon posters.  Three
evenly spaced windows are covered with heavy black curtains, allowing little
to no light from the street.  The small room is crowded with furniture
consisting of an old pull out sofa covered in plushies and fuzzy pillows,
fronted by a coffee table which carries tiny cacti and Venus flytraps.  An
old, overstuffed, orange tweed armchair kept together with duct tape sits
facing an antiquated television topped by a VCR and a cheap DVD player. 
Beside the armchair rests a table with a remote control and a small,
exquisitely hand drawn #wpicture#n that is lovingly framed.  A cheap
bookcase filled with exercise videos and DVD's including (but not limited
to) the complete Tai Bo workout and Belly Dancing for Fitness stands in the
corner of the room.

#rApartment J Upper Loft#n~
A heavy steel bar is bolted to either side of the doorframe approximately
four inches from the top of the jam.  The peeling, eggshell white walls of
this upper room are covered in posters of different fitness gurus ranging
from #PRichard#n Simmons to Suzanne Somers to Billy Blanks.  Approximately
eight feet by ten feet, the floor is covered in ancient, cracked, cream and
yellow linoleum that smells strongly of bleach and windex.  In the middle
sits an old steel workout bench whose metal has been rewelded and the
upholstery duct taped, various fitness magazines and supplies are piled
neatly around it.  A mixture of Walmart sand filled dumbbells are stacked
into their holder against the wall.  A very large mirror is attached to the
wall, the top left corner is missing and the edges are rough where the
reflective surface has begun to chip away.  A large dumbell with a total of
300lbs of weights on it is sitting on the floor next to the bench.  Small
hooks attached to the wall carry an assortment of jumpropes, hand
exercisers, and elastics.

with a disco ball and a sprinkling of different musical notes.

After passing through the small door leading from the street into the

address of the apartment.

This room has a ceramic fireplace in the far wall.  A large leather sofa
trimmed by a crimson velvet back lay resting in front of the fireplace.  The
opposite side of the room is a small bar with three stools place carefully .
The floors are made of English cherry wood the molding seems to be turn of
the century hand crafted, The small leaves seem to lunge out at one as they
glance at them.  The ceiling seems to have been made of a much richer dark
cherry wood.  Over the black and red flecked marble fireplace is a portrait
of a flawless Raven mane beauty, her steel blue eyes seem to pierce from the
netherworld as she watches your move.  Photographs of a fair skinned red
hair young woman seem to line the wall many of these pictures have similar
motif, her eyes lay shut as she slumbers peacefully.  Two folded flags lay
on a shelf on the south wall.  Each sealed in an airtight glass case. 
Photographs of three uniformed soldiers in various poses line the wall
behind the pictures.  All with a youthful and boyish sense of arrogance
often attributed with young boys who test the bounds of their existence. 
Bookshelves line the walls holding every type of book imaginable.  A sound
system also lies on this wall.  A huge rack with multi CDs.  From the 60"s,
modern and classical lay on the floor under the shelf.

This room has the same marble floor as the bathroom and is lit only by
two wall fixtures.  Each is on either side of the massive canopy bed.  The
bed itself is covered in a thick Black silk covered down comforter.  Crimson
silk bed linens peek over the fur-lined top of the comforter.  The top of
the bed has many large black and crimson Pillows cast about the massive
headboard.  The hand carved headboard is dark rich wood.  The scene engraved
in the headboard seems to be the temptation of Adam.  Carved in the center
of the headboard is the tree of knowledge with a coiled serpent.  A sleek
black velvet sofa lies in front of a large fireplace.  A few small pillows
lay cast about it.  A silk screen rests in the south east corner the scene
inscribed on its flawless silk canvas is the ascension of a Samurai.  A
small dresser stands nearby its cherry wood finish is traced by detailed
hand carvings of vine work along the border.  A recessed book shelf holding
many classical works of fine reading lay resting there along with books such
as Mien Komf, Art of war, Way of the Samurai and many other philosophy
books.  A small marble top night stand lays to the right hand side of the
bed with a small Tiffany brass lamp just below the lamp on the table lays a
new reprint of the Malcoruim Malficum.  A birth certificate Ambrose Lecroix
1999, death certificate Ambrose Lecroix 1999 and divorce papers dated 2003. 
Lies on the small identical table opposite of the table .  A single subsonic
hydro shock bullet lays cast among the papers it rests in a small ring case.

A shower stall lies in the east corner of the room encased dark curtain of
black tinted glass just barely obscuring vision inside.  The stall its self
is black tile with four showerheads made of fine brass on either end-facing
center.  A sink rest southeast next to a cabinet made of dark rich cherry
wood.  The black toilet sits in the east wall with a small vanity the frame
where the mirror belongs seems to be missing.  A door leads south again into
the master chamber.  On either side of this door are two massive sculptures
of red stone each a lion laying poised for attack.

#wThe Living Room#n~
The walls have been painted cream, the only thing to break the monotony
being the border of soft peach lotus and sage green leaves circling the room
near the ceiling.  The ecru, woollen carpet on the floor is of fine quality,
soft and plush to touch.  The windows are adorned with heavy, plush velvet
drapes hanging all the way to the ground.  The sage-green couch in the
corner by the windows looks enticingly full and quite big enough for four
people.  In front of it is an oval coffee table of some light wood and on
the opposite wall an entertainment center spreads out offering everything
from a plasma tv to DVD, VCR and stereo equipment.  Serious looking books,
including literary classics and non-fiction tomes, stand on the top shelf
above a collection of videos and DVD's.  Next to the entertainment center
looms an old vitrine with the lower doors made of wood and the upper of
glass.  Diagonally from the couch, in the corner next to the door is a small
desk with a tabletop computer on it and a very nice looking yellow, leather
covered office chair.  A handful of houseplants give life to the room.

The tiny kitchenette seems very clean.  It is fully equipped with the
usual appliances to cater for almost any chef.  The sink is of shiny steel,
looking almost polished.  The ceramic tiles on the floor echo the ochre
color of the cabinet doors, while the walls themselves are off-white.  There
is not table or chairs in this cramped, but efficiently used room.  The
bright lights make up for the lack of a window, but also make the room less
cosy.

Possibly a former garderobe, this bedroom is tiny and dark.  Apart from

The drawer under the bed provides more storage room, or possibly a spare
bed.  The blue and sea-green tones of this room are as soothing to the eye
as the silk on the bed is to the body.  The lights have been chosen to be
soft, natural color to offset the lack of window and an air-conditioner hums
constantly making sure the air remains fresh.

#ePlantation Road#n~
Cypress trees and moss block out the majority of all light upon this
road.  The darkness seems to draw in everything near and far as the forest
and swamp lands enclose the whole area.  There seems to be very little hope
for any sort of sign of civilization in the near future, other than a
gigantic pillared plantation mansion off the main road and past a huge
expanse of a burned out forecourt to the south.  Travel south is blocked by
a pair of iron gates, which have been torn from the hinges somehow, and lay
in piles of rubble.  The mansion visible beyond the yard and gate is now a
scorched out hull.

As the door opens, a view of a spacious room with a descent #rdark-red
couch#n and two #eblack lounge chairs#n.  Infront of the couch, a nice glass
top, wooden stand sits.  Several books fill the one main bookcase within the
room as it has a painting and a poster on each side of the bookcase.  To the
left of the door, the nicely equiped kitchen is located with a lovely
sidebar with stools underneath.  To the right, there is a short hallway as
it leads directly towards the two bedrooms within the apartment.  Across
from the front door, a screened sliding doors are seen as they lead out to
the balcony.

Balcony~
Walking out the sliding doors, the view is somewhat one that is to be seen by 
one's eyes. Looking over the railing, a sea of lights from the buildings 
across the way and down the street are seen. A small wire table with two chairs 
rests the platform of the balcony with an assortment of candles resting ontop 
of the table. Christmas lights entangle the railing, only lit up when a flip of 
a switch is done.

Bedroom~
Once within the room, the dark colors draw out the seductive qualities of setting 
of the mood. This room is quite larger than the other bedroom within the apartment 
as full size bathroom connects to it. Room is painted in the dark colors within the
different hues of crimson and black. Her bed is covered with a red, silver and black
patched work quilt that rests over a soft dow comforter. Her back broad has an 
assortment of pillows and shams. Candles rests on each of the dark wooden stands by 
her bed amongst a few pictures of her family. Across from her bed is her large armoir
that holds her television by its closed doors and her clothing within the drawers
underneath. The walls behind her bed and armoir are the color of night as the 
opposite walls are the color of crimson red. The crimson red walls are decorated 
with assorted pictures of wolves and assorted artwork.

nightstand rests with a decorative lamp and small trinkets about the surface. A 
full size dresser with mirror lies against the side wall, next to the closet, 
with a stationary pad and other items resting on top. Adjacent to the bed is the 
15' TV resting on its stand with a small cable box. The bed is covered with a 
dark blue patterned quilt with soft pillows resting agianst the backboard.

`gSkirting an Enormous Willow`n~
Pushing through the reeds of the swamp, one finds their view to be
restricted to a narrow corridor along a well-trodden path.  To the south,
there is a high wall of cattail reeds and other vegetation, but to the north
the high, green dome of a massive willow tree rises up over the horizon. 
The outer branches are dense and close together, forming a sort of natural
curtain that obscures most of whatever lies within.  Eastward, the path
continues on between high turves, smaller willows, and cypress trees, as it
does back to the west.

#wLiving Room#n~
Just in from the front door is a small entrance hall with a closet for
coats.  This opens up to a combined living dining area but at the moment is
just being used as one large room.  The place is still painted in apartment
beige but most of the walls are covered with posters of various alternative
rockers and some band from the late sixties like The Doors and Jimmy
Hendrix.  Along one wall is a large sectional couch.  It is a mottled
blue/brown color and is very worn, but looks very comfortable.  There is a
big black fleece blanket with a picture of a sleek female cat on it thrown
over another large chair.  Two large speakers, a tv and stereo system take
over most of the other side of the wall.  Where the dining room would be,
another chair sits by itself.  There is a small black amplifier beside it
and a small keyboard hooked up to it.  On the other side is a guitar stand. 
Down the hall leads off to the bathroom and bedroom and a door opens up to
the small kitchen.

The first door off the hallway is the bedroom.  The typical flimsy door
has been replaced by a strong solid wood door that bolts closed from the
inside.  There is no bed, just a king-sized mattress that has been thrown in
the corner of the room and is not made.  Though there is a dresser with a
large mirror it looks like it isn't being used as there are piles of clothes
spread over the floor.  The sliding door that leads out to the Balcony is
covered by a very thick dark, red velvet curtain and behind that is a
horizontal blind that are both closed.  A very large boom box is sitting on
the floor beside the bed and an overly full ashtray sits on top of it.

A great soaking tub dominates the small bathroom and looks like it was

new and has pictures of a stylized sleek female looking cat on it.  The rest
of the room keeps up the cat motif with the toilet cover and tooth brush and
soap holders.  There are 5 lights over the sink and mirror but also a dozen
or so candles spread out and look used.

Deep freezer~
The freezer is large and deep, its walls stretching back for at least
twenty feet and across by fifteen, giving any who enter the impression that
a large store of meat product was housed here.  Hooks akin to those on the
main warehouse floor swing idle from the ceiling, though most of these hold
carcass jackets usually used to encase the dead torsos within their white
plastic protection.  One light blinks on when the door is opened, casting a
bluish white light across the space.

civilization in the near future.

`eAn empty yard between warehouses`n~
This circular space is empty save for the twin lines of steel which
seemingly acted as tracks for shifting large quantities of meat from the
northern warehouse to the southern packing plant.  It is a square shape made
originally of concrete, however, weeds currently dominate the space,
sprouting up through all available areas; through cracks, against walls, and
even along the rusted tracks.  The sky is visible above the yard, not
blocked by anything more than a telephone cable long since unused.  The
tracks lead to another metal shutter on the northern building, another
warehouse just slightly smaller than the packing plant while an open wooden
door leads to a small security shack to the east.

Next to nothing occupies this tiny security shack save for an empty water
cooler, a desk and a small chair.  Upon the desk there is a microphone and
telephone, though the usability of both is questionable.  The windows are
all boarded up tightly, and although the door is wooden is appears to be
securable with a hefty metal bolt lock.

`eA meat processing warehouse`n~
The hooks lining this warehouse are fewer in number but greater of
purpose, for they line the ceiling above what appears to be machinery used
to disembowel, dissect or otherwise cut up the carcases that move through
them.  Many blades are visible, poking out from thick, straight-sided steel
casings, or simply in the form of large circular saws which stand elevated
at either side of the machine line.  The spillway beneath is stained a vivid
shade of orange-red, the colour of blood.  The room itself is not as big,
nor as airy as the packing space, its closed walls and somewhat violent feel
providing a distinct sense of claustrophobic closeness to all those affected
by such things.  Several freezers line the walls, much like the other
warehouse, while a thin iron staircase ascends up toward a steel door near
the roof of the building leading to what could quite possibly be an office.

`eThe Boardroom`n~
This room is built into the upper level of the warehouse so close to the
roof that most of the ceiling had originally been a rectangular glass dome. 
Now, however, it has been built over with stone and plaster to crease a
smooth, solid roof to the space.  The feeling of abandoned, run down
ambience that inhabits the meat plant as a whole does not touch this room,
leaving no doubt that time and money had been spent in its construction. 
Dimmed, mood-setting lights are installed along the edge of the floor, sunk
in against the walls in much the same way as theatre lights, providing just
enough light for casual use while the small spotlights across the ceiling
provide bright, room-filling light when needed.  A vast polished mahogany
board table acts as the focal point and name-giver of the room, surrounded
by twelve comfortable-looking black leather chairs, each one able to pivot
in full circle.  A thick, heavily-set steel door gives access to the roof
while a simple polished wooden door leeds east into the haven common room.

`eCommon room`n~
The common room is by no means a large room, at least not when compared
to the warehouse spaces prior, but it is comfortably accommodating for a
fair number of Cainites to congregate.  The walls are utterly windowless and
of a polished, stained mahogany which lines them in tight, regal panels
which suggest expense and effort.  Lighting much akin to the boardroom
provides a dim, proud elegance to the area which is home to four very soft
burgundy leather sofas, each one studded with brass at its arm and body
seems.  The floor is of polished wooden boards, however, a thick, rich red
rug covers almost all of it.  There is little further in manner of
decoration, though the room feels complete regardless.

This is the living room of an average-looking apartment, of more or 
less regular size for such a place. The walls are painted a deep 
turquoise, and various posters, art and a few calligraphic poems in 
wooden frames hang on them. The area at the front door is tiled, a 
few pairs of sandals thrown about on them, but the rest is a cream-
colored carpet. A wooden coffee table sits in front of a navy blue 
couch on the right side. Set up opposite both is an electronic 
keyboard, with sheaves of music paper on the stand, and near it a 
couple of self-assembled bookshelves packed to the brim with books 
of all sorts. There is a rectangular window facing out, thick 
burgundy curtains usually drawn over it. A small desk is set up 
directly to the right of it where a laptop, a printer, a cordless 
phone and a small desk-lamp lie. Paper and empty water bottles 
cover the surface haphazardly. A narrow hall leads to three more 
rooms.

usually graced with unwashed dishes of some kind. There is a large 
refrigerator with an ice dispenser near the corner of the room, and 
all around are cupboards for dishes. At the other side, where one 
walks out to the living room through the tiled front door, there is 
a pantry and a broom closet standing side-by-side. The living room 
is just across the bar.

`eJackson Square (Avg. NPCs: 42)`n~
Surrounded by a massive iron-wrought fence still standing from the city's
French Colonial origins, Jackson Square was once a hub of elegance at the
center of the Quarter; an echo of an time long faded, where the homeless
would gather after dusk to interact and sleep under the light of the tall
iron lamps, long after ladies and gentlemen had abandoned the beautiful
gardens and curling paved walkways for home.  While the remnants of that
lost age linger in the perfectly shaped hedges, greenery and gardens of
tropical blooming plants, the monument of Andrew Jackson on a rearing horse
in black iron and the white face of the looming cathedral, litter and reek
fills the crevices between cobblestones, and rot creeps through the European
architecture.  The Saint Louis Cathedral rises some two hundred feet above
the square.  Cathedral bells chime regularly from the high towers, keeping
time with the mythically large white-faced clock that faces the square. 
Like in nights of old the Square is a hotspot for dealers, prostitutes,
musicians and vagrants, the lot of who flock to this underworld bazaar and
fill the benches, paths and steps before the cathedral with wares.  When the
sun rises they will be gone, but after dark this place belongs only to the
underworld.

`eJackson Square (Avg. NPCs: 42)`n~
Surrounded by a massive iron-wrought fence still standing from the French
Colonial eighteenth century, Jackson Square was once a hub of elegance at
the center of the Quarter; an echo of an time long faded, where the homeless
would gather after dusk to interact and sleep under the light of the tall
gothic-styled Victorian lamps, long after ladies and gentlemen had abandoned
the beautiful gardens and curling paved walkways for home.  While the
remnants of that lost age linger in the perfectly shaped hedges, greenery
and gardens of tropical blooming plants, the monumental statue of some
legendary man on a rearing horse in black iron at the center of a circular
cobblestone path, and the white face of the looming cathedral, litter and
reek fills the crevaces in the paths, and grime has begun to dull even the
most beautiful aspects of Parisian architecture.  The Saint Louis Cathedral
rises some two hundred feet above the square itself, it's bells chiming
regularly from the high towers and the almost mythically large white-faced
clock giving the accurate time with two curling iron hands.  Much like in
the nights of old, the Square has again become a hotspot for dealers,
prostitutes, musicians and vagrants, the lot of who flock for a form of
underworld bazaar, filling the benches, paths and the steps before the
cathedral with their carts and belongings.  When dawn lights they will be
long gone, but by night this place belongs wholly to the underworld, making
it one of the most dangerous places in New Orleans after dark.  Upon the
southern side, the smells of beignets and fresh coffee drifts into the
street from `rCafe du Monde`n.

#gThe City Park, Greater New Orleans#n~
Centuries-old live oak trees tower and loom over the largest urban
greenspace in the United States.  The City Park's founding in 1853 makes it
not just the largest, but also one of the oldest in the country.  The Bayou
Metairie swells through the green lands like pulsing arteries, with 19th
century stone bridges spanning these preserved sections of the bayou.  On
the south shore the park is bordered by Lake Pontchartrain, a brackish
estuary and one of the largest wetlands in the world.  A century ago several
lanes were platted for streets by city planners, though none were ever
realized.  Sculptures by Enrique Alferez pepper the landscape; mermaids and
mermen stained green with soggy moss jut up out of the lawns and behind the
trunks of several century-old trees.  There are hundreds of benches, picnic
tables and brick barbeques secluded around the park.  Dedicated bikeways
circle the greenspace's entirety, and landscaped walks debuted years ago to
allow direct passage both to Lake Pontchartrain and the New Orleans
Botanical Gardens.

`eJackson Square (Avg. NPCs: 42)`n~
Surrounded by a massive iron-wrought fence still standing from the city's
French Colonial origins, Jackson Square was once a hub of elegance at the
center of the Quarter; an echo of an time long faded, where the homeless
would gather after dusk to interact and sleep under the light of the tall
iron lamps, long after ladies and gentlemen had abandoned the beautiful
gardens and curling paved walkways for home.  While the remnants of that
lost age linger in the perfectly shaped hedges, greenery and gardens of
tropical blooming plants, the monument of Andrew Jackson on a rearing horse
in black iron and the white face of the looming cathedral, litter and reek
fills the crevices between cobblestones, and rot creeps through the European
architecture.  The Saint Louis Cathedral rises some two hundred feet above
the square.  Cathedral bells chime regularly from the high towers, keeping
time with the mythically large white-faced clock that faces the square. 
Like in nights of old the Square is a hotspot for dealers, prostitutes,
musicians and vagrants, the lot of who flock to this underworld bazaar and
fill the benches, paths and steps before the cathedral with wares.  When the
sun rises they will be gone, but after dark this place belongs only to the
underworld.

#cLake Pontchartrain, South Shore#n~
The Mandeville lighthouse on the west estuary of the Tchefuncte River is
the only source of light on Lake Ponchartrain come nightfall, and what
little it provides rotates around the lantern room, a spotlamp that
circulates palely to and fro.  Though not a true lake, Ponchartrain is vast
enough to experience minor tidal changes, supporting its own current and
rising, falling surf.  The lake region includes a quarter million acres of
wetland including bottom land hardwoods and cypress swamps, along with a
complex mixture of herbaceous growth and an intermediate, brackisk marsh. 
Receiving fresh water from the Tangipahoa, Tchefuncte, Tickfaw, Amite and
Bogue Felaya rivers as well as the Bayou Lacombe and Chincuba, the lake
swells rapidly during storms, pushing water in from the Gulf of Mexico as a
hurricane approaches.  The shores of Ponchartrain are saline and marshy with
lips of foam lapping the earth.  The waters are packed with a generous
medley of aquatic wildlife.  Night mooring boats often linger through dawn
on the open water, anchored well away from the water's edge.  The Lady
Pontchartrain ferry boat bobs and mulls in the currents, taking passengers
around the lake both day and night.

`rPirate's Alley; Wilkonson (Avg. NPCs: 6)`n~
Buildings loom up three stories on both sides of the alley, displaying
classic wrought iron double balconies with hanging ferns.  The infamous
cobblestoned alley is the subject of much legend and lore, some true, and
much false.  Some claim that it was a haven for dueling pirates in days
past, while others claimed that slaves were sold at the adjacent St. 
Anthony's Garden on Royal Street.  The much photographed "Pirate's Alley"
lamppost's illumination does not extend too far down into the alley in the
evening; the area has a mystique and slightly foreboding atmosphere at this
time of the night.  Due to the darkness the alley is sparsely populated. 
While Jackson Square is dark, it holds nothing on the humid blackness
filling this walkway.  Vines pregnant with flowers choke the walls, gates
and shops, unchecked and wild as they push through plaster, brick and
pavement.

#gNew Orleans Botanical Gardens#n~
The botanical gardens are made up of several different miniature gardens,
each showcasing a unique species of flora, and pathways and structures to
define and separate the sections.  Grass runways lined with hedges of
camellia dominate the enclosure, and brick pathways with objects constructed
in thanks of donors vein the landscape.  Visitors taking the easterly
direction enter the Zemurray Azalea and Camellia Garden, which houses
azalea, camellia and magnolias; a fragrant walk through some of the South's
most famous flowering plants.  The western edge of this garden boasts the
Pavilion of the Two Sisters, a recent building designed in the fashion of a
European greenhouse that protects oranges and honors the Wordsworth sisters.
The Two Sisters serves as a formal barrier between the Zemurray Garden and
the rest.  To the west of the pavilion are four distinct outdoor garden
doors, a reflecting pool and a conservatory made of pale orange adobe.  The
Parterre Rose Garden consists of tightly trimmed Yaupon hedges outlining
rose beds, guarded by two large arbors.  All the walkways converge at the
middle, leading through paths of herbaceous and tropical blooms, ornamental
grasses and woody shrubs.  The most prominent feature in all four gardens is
the century-old Alferez Oak tree, named for the sculptor of many pieces in
the garden.  There is an aquatic planting area with lilies, fish and other
flora and fauna flanking the eastern edge of the Conservatory.

#rThe Lady Pontchartrain II#n~
The Lady Pontchartrain II moves around the lake it was named for both day
and night.  Twin water wheels generate enough power that the Lady II stops
for passengers once an hour at each of the main four docks.  While cars and
motorbikes may provide faster transportation over the Causeway spanning the
lake from Metairie to North Shore there is something very romantic and
traditional about crossing the lake by ferry.  The churning water wheels
create twin sprays of white mist that shower down upon the churning blue
green waters that reflect the days light.  Awning covered benches provide
seating for the passengers and pennants flutter along the rails adding to
the festive feel of the ferry.  A large painted sign hangs across both sides
of the main housing so no one has to wonder about the various stops or
rates, it reads in big bold letters: 
#n
#C                  Daily Rate - $1.50 per boarding pass                  
#C                Weekly Rate $15.00 - Monthly Rate $45.00 
#n
#C       (OC: The ferry is very loud, overhearing conversations by

#cLake Pontchartrain, North Shore#n~
Lush green grass thins out into fine gravel and small stone beach that is
licked by the tide of blue waters.  From the shore of the lake, in the far
distance looms a causeway that crosses the canal that leads out to the Gulf.
The sun or moon glistens off the water and sparkles like diamonds in its
brilliance.  There is the Pontchartrain Ferry Dock to the south, a Mooring
for private boathouses here or there, and the small village of Mandeville
skirting around and nestling into a large glade of the bayou to the north. 
Several middle class homes and businesses fill the spaces the bayou
provides.  A thick fog hangs over the area, muffling all sounds and turning
even familiar landmarks into vague, alien shapes.  The pale, watery light
manages to alleviate the gloom only marginally.  A fluttering breeze can
occasionally be felt, rustling a few leaves then whispering away.

#cThe village of Mandeville#n~
Mandeville is a picturesque village of a town with quaint cottages over
looking the bayou.  Main Street is made up of a combination post office and
town hall, general store and some trendy boutiques, small restaurants and
local bar.  Just enough to make this a nice vacation place.  Two story homes
with their white balconies and wide porches mix with shotgun style house. 
During the day, the town is bustling with people at their cottages from
Baton Rogue and further north.  A thick fog hangs over the area, muffling
all sounds and turning even familiar landmarks into vague, alien shapes. 
The pale, watery light manages to alleviate the gloom only marginally.  A
fluttering breeze can occasionally be felt, rustling a few leaves then
whispering away.  To the west behind a fence that partially obscures the
view of the grounds sits an old red brick building constructed in the 1800s.
An arched set of black wooden double doors leads into the main room of the
shop on the first floor.

`eThe Intersection of Decatur and Toulouse (Avg. NPCs: 20)`n~
Little more at it's origin than a series of offshoot streets, narrow
alleyways and layered, terraced Parisian balconies that line the faces of
the pink or pale yellow painted buildings, nothing that has been modernized
about the modern Decatur Street manages to detract from a historical, almost
theme-park-like air of antiquity.  The sidewalks are old, dark grey paved,
weaving beneath balconies and overhangs bordered by their simple pillars or
iron poles.  Potted greenery dangles in lines from the balconies, and air
conditioning units whir with life at all times of the night, blowing chilled
air into the flats.  Tall cypress trees nestle in between buildings and on
almost every street corner, riddled with draping Spanish Moss and
accompanied by the more occasional maple or oak.  The architecture is
antiquated to the extreme, and the street signs, vehicles parked beside the
sidewalks and othersuch modern touches contrast violently with the
historical feel, providing a distinct, charming anachronism.  Every few
yards a very old iron fire hydrant has been installed into the sidewalk,
rusted from top to bottom.  Here trickles of foot traffic seem to drift down
the steps to the south in a calmer fashion, leading walkers to the
`bboardwalk along the Mississippi`n, it's heavy wooden planks and metal
railings visible from this vantage point.

`eThe Intersection of Decatur and Canal (Avg. NPCs: 25)`n~
Stone grey, brown and maroon brickwork embodies the distinct form of
Canal Street as 1920's vogue; buildings each individually structured to be
formal, grand and appealing to the senses while at the same time mundane,
conforming to the purpose of their design - that being mostly aged apartment
buildings, restaurants and clubs - all vying for prominence, and in effect
becoming squashed, wedged and messy in segmented blocks; all the while
outdone and outclassed by the towering prongs of a decade or so later;
jagged sky-scraping structures loom into dominance in their occasional
appearance along the lengthy Canal.  Narrow windows peer out onto a wide
street lit by lamps or all hues between dying orange and vibrant white, and
neon-buzzing business fronts; each contrasting with the glimmers of traffic
signals and the occasional alleyway tipped with a burning barrel.  Roaming
youths, staggering street ladies, huddled homeless and shattered bottles
reveal the culture that exists illuminated by moonlight.  Just to the east,
Decatur Street leads people off towards the French Quarter.

from a bustling, old-fashioned farmer's market with fresh vegetables,

various commercial beverages like Pepsi or IBC Rootbeer to darker sorts of
merchants carting in their wares; there is no better place in New Orleans,
save for perhaps the Square, to find a more thorough selection of varying
black market commerce.  For the most part, no wares are out for display

customers looking for them rather than attempting to entice anybody passing
by.  The sole exception are the vodoun booths, where men and women peddle
off little luck trinkets, charms or various gris-gris.

#gIn the Bayou - Rural Route Northeast Bayou#n~
The area stretches out endlessly, is the bayou cut by a ribbon of
pavement that turns southwest and northeast.  A gravel road emerges heading
off to the south.  Snowy white lilies skim the murky surface, their
sickeningly sweet floral scent hiding something darker, more ominous.  The
lilies seethe with movement as tiny frogs jump from flower to flower, their
dull green and brown speckled backs blight on the bright whiteness.  The
croaks of the frogs drown out the hum of the locusts, and mighty splashes
occur periodically as hordes of them hop into the water, sending waves and
ripples through the bayou.  A thick fog hangs over the area, muffling all
sounds and turning even familiar landmarks into vague, alien shapes.  The
pale, watery light manages to alleviate the gloom only marginally.  A
fluttering breeze can occasionally be felt, rustling a few leaves then
whispering away.

The river wall blocks any view of the boardwalk or Mississippi River from
the area, which after dark transforms from a bustling, old-fashioned
farmer's market with fresh vegetables, crawfish, homemade gumbo, voodoo
implements and questionable delectables like crocodile sausages intermingled
with standing coolers packed with various commercial beverages like Pepsi or

#gCampsite - A Quiet Glade#n~
The sweet scents of lush vegetation fill the humid air within this grove
of trees.  A thick fog hangs over the area, muffling all sounds and turning
even familiar landmarks into vague, alien shapes.  The pale, watery light
manages to alleviate the gloom only marginally.  A fluttering breeze can
occasionally be felt, rustling a few leaves then whispering away.  The tree
canopies interlock overhead in all but a small area in the center of the
grove, providing a comfortable shade in the normally balmy bayou.  The grove
is tranquil, occasionally stirred by the soft calls of animals that seem to
have found some measure of peace with each other here.  A large pool of
water, clear except for the occasional new-fallen leaf, reflects back some
of the sunlight.  Overhead, thick growths of spanish moss hang down from the
trees as if stretching to try to reach the ground.  The undergrowth is
sparse here and mainly composed of ferns and soft grasses.  Upon closer
inspection, signs of a human presence become apparent.  An iron grate rests
over a fire pit lined with smooth river stones, and several large logs have
been pulled around it to be used as seats.  A few well-worn paths traverse
the glade, headed out.

The natural splendor of moss hanging majestically from the Cypress trees,
missing the coils of snakes that sun themselves on the upper branches.  It
is almost cool here, although the humidity still rises from the slowly
moving waters.  A quick glance catches the twitch of a serpentine tail as it
glides over the scummy surface of the swamp.  A *plop* behind makes gets a
person's attention in time to see a brilliantly colored water moccasin
slithering through the bayou, its body moving sensuously, searching for
prey.

A few buildings of five to six stories in height are placed in a planned
layout amidst what seems to be a peaceful forest of tall cypresses and
maintained grass lawns.  Pavements link each building to each other, large
plastic plaques on each of these buildings indicate the departments and
facilities available in them.  Electric lampposts line most of the
pavements, keeping them lighted.  The buildings themselves have large
windows, some of which dark, while others, an encased flourescent glow emits
from them.  A large parking lot is found near to the entrance into the
building, a paybooth with a barricade stationed at the exit.  The Institute
is fenced in by a tall, dark brown metal fence running around the entire
perimeter.

the entrance of the Riverwalk Shopping Center draws in many shoppers to the
various shops.  The mall stretches along the bank of the Mississippi River
and boasts a major shopping experience for any that pass through.

#CSt. Ann Street before The City Park#n~
Where St.  Ann Street ends there is a parking lot that borders the
sparkling waters of Lake Pontchartrain.  To the northwest is a very large
marina that houses a mooring for large commercial boats and the smaller
stylish boats of a Yacht Club.  To the north is a long stretch of #gThe City
Park#n greenspace before it thins out into gentle dunes of white sand before
it flattens into Pontchartrain Beach.  The pale grains of sand sparkle and
reflect the light.  Along one side of the parking lot, butting up against
the park is a picnic area where metal grated coal grills are stuck in the
ground and picnic tables are randomly placed.  The large cypress trees and
weeping willows give some shade in the daytime.  A prized property beach
house with a view to die for is nestled off to the north east.  Down the the
street to the east is the University of New Orleans to the northeast and at
the end of the road at the far east side is Benjamin Franklin High School. 
People can be seen along the banks and on the docks fishing early in the
morning.  The entire area is always rather populated with teens, college
kids, and those who enjoy boating and beach going fun of all ages.

competition with the variety of restaurants and other eateries.  Everything
from classic New Orleans cuisine, fudge and chocolates, to regular burger

knot of on and off ramps.  Private residences and commercial areas are both
rampant along the causeway.  Pine trees and highway buffer walls tower over
head and dark green shrubs flank the asphalt road as it winds its way to and
fro.  Kudzu vines and long shanks of moss commonly called "old mans beard"
drip from the branches of the trees, creating a ghostly quality in the

`eCanal Street (Avg. NPCs: 55)`n~
Stone grey, brown and maroon brickwork embodies the distinct form of
Canal Street as 1920's vogue; buildings each individually structured to be
formal, grand and appealing to the senses while at the same time mundane,
conforming to the purpose of their design - that being mostly aged apartment
buildings, restaurants and clubs - all vying for prominence, and in effect
becoming squashed, wedged and messy in segmented blocks; all the while
outdone and outclassed by the towering prongs of a decade or so later;
jagged sky-scraping structures loom into dominance in their occasional
appearance along the lengthy Canal.  Narrow windows peer out onto a wide
street lit by lamps or all hues between dying orange and vibrant white, and
neon-buzzing business fronts; each contrasting with the glimmers of traffic
signals and the occasional alleyway tipped with a burning barrel.  Roaming
youths, staggering street ladies, huddled homeless and shattered bottles
reveal the culture that exists illuminated by moonlight.  A renovated
apartment building with all the trappings of a sepia photograph gone to dust
sits jauntily to the west of the street, on which `oJuan Soliz and
Associates`n is embedded on the heavy cast-iron sign above the doors.

`eCanal Street before Pentex Corporate Headquarters (Avg. NPCs: 65)`n~
A slight contrast to the sheer and hardened dark of the Canal Street
blocks can be found as the road moves its way onward; that being a `rPentex
Corporate Headquarters`n, it's glittering pale steel frame standing out as a
towering monolith next to the black mirror windowed skyscrapers that huddle
close on either side.  Jammed between two torn down lots across the street
from this beautiful example of modern architecture is `oHarrah's Casino`n,
it's thick, heavy brickwork masquerading as a sleek, upper-crust
establishment behind a fool-me-not wash of paint and decorus neon signs. 
The surrounding lot, alley and frontal entrance is not only drenched within
music, but a seedy collection of hookers, dealers, pimps and thugs; some of
which moonlight as bouncers, none of which seem particularly concerned by
the exquisite Pentex urban-monsterousity across the four lane road.

appearance along the lengthy Canal.  Narrow windows peer out onto a wide
street lit by lamps or all hues between dying orange and vibrant white, and
neon-buzzing business fronts; each contrasting with the glimmers of traffic
signals and the occasional alleyway tipped with a burning barrel.  Roaming
youths, staggering street ladies, huddled homeless and shattered bottles
reveal the culture that exists illuminated by moonlight.  To the east,
Dauphin Street is home to many locals and small cafes and bars.

#CSt. Louis St.#n~
With a border shared by the Garden District and the historic St.  Charles
Avenue streetcar running people back and forth between the two regions, St. 
Louis Street sees more tourism than much of the Downtown area, and the
culture bubbling up from the street reflects that.  Proximity to both Uptown
universities, Loyola and Tulane, has made St.  Louis Street a favorite
hangout for the college crowd and a growing number of creative locals. 
Several coffee shops with ample tables and WiFi connections sit below the
staggering backdrop of the city strip.  Exotic dining on ethnic cuisine is
offered in a number of small, intimate restaurants, and several small pubs
have sprouted up offering beer and cocktails after hours.  Most of the
buildings are centuries-old and made of brick, and shade trees line the
lamp-lit walkways.  A dark green awning hangs over the sidewalk, reading
#wParc Saint Charles#n in elegant white lettering.  Above the awning flutter
the flags of the United States, New Orleans, Louisiana and France.

Stone grey, brown and maroon brickwork embodies the distinct form of
Canal Street as 1920's vogue; buildings each individually structured to be
formal, grand and appealing to the senses while at the same time mundane,
conforming to the purpose of their design - that being mostly aged apartment
buildings, restaurants and clubs - all vying for prominence, and in effect
becoming squashed, wedged and messy in segmented blocks; all the while
outdone and outclassed by the towering prongs of a decade or so later;
jagged sky-scraping structures loom into dominance in their occasional

`eThe Intersection of North Rampart and Canal (Avg. NPCs: 45)`n~
Far removed from it's southern brothers, North Rampart Street bears no
real nightlife, no party-goers, and no tourists; what people there are
travel in clusters, huddling close to one another around barrels filled with
burning debris, or moving quick by the mouths of narrow alleyways reeking of
vomit, urine and worse.  The majority of streetlamps - being all of mundane,
modern design; none of the elegant Victorian replicas have carried over to
this portion of the city - are burned out or yellowed, buzzing sources of
light, often flickering on and off to leave anyone below in complete
darkness.  The occasional car creeps by, and from time to time a lone
individual can be seen settling down against the wall of an old shot-gun
styled building.  To the west, the `PLSU Medical Center`n can be seen in the
distance.

`eEsplande fades into Elsyian Fields Avenue (Avg. NPCs: 9)`n~
Cracked and broken roads prevent much of the vehicular travel down
tree-shaded Esplande by day, and nearly all of it by night.  Those who do
trek the ragged asphault do so by motorcycle, or more daringly, on foot or
bike, so as best to avoid the numerous potholes and all around decrepit
state of the area.  After sunset no police patrol this stretch of road, and
such is readily visible in the graffiti that splashes out vibrant urban
paintscapes - everything from 'Fuck Bush' and less savoury, messy curses
painted in solid colors to murals of genuine talent.  Bars line every window
and snug old Spanish courtyards enclose every home or day-time business. 
The sidewalks are every bit as crooked and broken as the road, illuminated
with a circular spot of greyish light every fifteen yards.  To the north,
the road continues on but to the south, Esplanade runs right into the `rOld
French Market`n.

`eThe Intersection of Royal and Esplande (Avg. NPCs: 7)`n~
Royal Street is undoubtedly one of the more policed areas of the French
Quarter, such being made evident simply by the average wealth of those whom
populate the street; yuppies, oldies and the guy who knew how to smile as he
killed.  Elegant wrought-iron posts encase bright, clear lamps along both
opposing sidewalks, spread apart by dotted trees and bollards in perfect
lines, almost as if the pavement was designed to keep undesirable things
out, or in.  The buildings range in both size and shape, though they are all
cleanly and respectable as a rule; however, as wealthy as the street is,
there are still elements of the decrepit city outside of its borders;
half-dead bums sleeping rough against cleaned dumpsters and the dealer the
inhabitants know by name.  Hookers patrol regularly, but if you're buying,
expect to be set back several hundred.  The tall iron gates of Gallier House
can be seen after the junction.

Little more than nondescript collection of century-old brick mercantile
warehouses, Perdido Street went through major transformation in the
mid-1980s when a portion was included in the boundary of the New Orleans
World Fair.  Housing several exposition attractions, including the Italian
Village, the fair provided the catalyst for a revival of Perdido Street. 
Today this one-block section is a pedestrian-only outdoor mall that has
rapidly become a popular downtown destination for those seeking respite from
the fast pace of urban life.  Restaurants and pubs fronting the streetsides
provide outdoor tables where patrons can relax under colored awnings and
canvas umbrellas.  The stained glass windows of #rFoxtail#n, a two-story
restaurant and club to the east, are framed with turquiose and copper
fittings.

#CPerdido Street#n~
Little more than nondescript collection of century-old brick mercantile
warehouses, Perdido Street went through major transformation in the
mid-1980s when a portion was included in the boundary of the New Orleans
World Fair.  Housing several exposition attractions, including the Italian
Village, the fair provided the catalyst for a revival of Perdido Street. 
Today this one-block section is a pedestrian-only outdoor mall that has
rapidly become a popular downtown destination for those seeking respite from
the fast pace of urban life.  Restaurants and pubs fronting the streetsides
provide outdoor tables where patrons can relax under colored awnings and
canvas umbrellas.

`eEsplande Avenue (Avg. NPCs: 3)`n~
Cracked and broken roads prevent much of the vehicular travel down
tree-shaded Esplande by day, and nearly all of it by night.  Those who do
trek the ragged asphault do so by motorcycle, or more daringly, on foot or
bike, so as best to avoid the numerous potholes and all around decrepit
state of the area.  After sunset no police patrol this stretch of road, and
such is readily visible in the graffiti that splashes out vibrant urban
paintscapes - everything from 'Fuck Bush' and less savoury, messy curses
painted in solid colors to murals of genuine talent.  Bars line every window
and snug old Spanish courtyards enclose every home or day-time business. 
The sidewalks are every bit as crooked and broken as the road, illuminated
with a circular spot of greyish light every fifteen yards.  To the south,
the rest of Esplanade Avenue extends into the rest of the French Quarter.

warehouse-gone-club, #PSpin#n.  Above the warehouse rotates a bright neon
sign.

`eThe Intersection of Burgundy and Esplanade (Avg. NPCs: 3)`n~
Packed on all sides with chipped-brick apartment buildings that cast long
shadows across the narrow, Cypress choked road, Burgundy is a solely
residential area, neither rich nor poor, thus displaying a dizzying meld of
both run-down structures, cracked sidewalks and aging shotgun homes blended
in with one-story Parisian condos and their enclosed courtyards.  Granite
gargoyles top wrought iron fences, looming strategically overhead with their
twisted faces turned into malicious grimaces.  Black iron, intricate
balconies line the apartment complexes, occasionally holding some personal
effect of the residents, though the majority are empty and dark, mere
open-faced pods by the thousands where people can stand or sit to watch the
goings on below.  Jasmine and vines grow thick, pushing wild through the
sidewalks and suffocating the lesser maintained of buildings.  The gutters
are filled with their share of litter, and the tall, gothic-Victorian
streetlamps from an age where gas, not electricity, was used to illuminate
them have never been modified to suit the modern age, lying dark and filled
with cobwebs instead of bulbs.  Esplande turns off to the north and south.

#wIntersection of Perdido and Julia Street#n~
There are three streets in new Orleans that are widely known for their
profusion of fine art galleries but only one of them has earned the nickname
"Gallery Row."  The first two are Royal and Magazine.  The third is Julia
Street, widely known as "Gallery Row" in the heart of the city's upscale
Warehouse Arts District.  More than a dozen art galleries, one after
another, line both sides of Julia Street, occupying former storefronts,
showrooms and other mercantile establishments that went out of business
decades ago.  Old factories are renovated into luxury condos while
street-level structures almost magically coalesce into a series of galleries
featuring the works of local and nationally known painters, sculptors and
mixed media artists.  Music pours through the street from hidden speakers in
the eaves, joining with the ruckus of traffic and many voices to create an
eerie cacophony.

`bNorth Rampart Street (Avg. NPCs: 2)`n~
Far removed from it's southern brothers, North Rampart Street bears no
real nightlife, no party-goers, and no tourists; what people there are
travel in clusters, huddling close to one another around barrels filled with
burning debris, or moving quick by the mouths of narrow alleyways reeking of
vomit, urine and worse.  The majority of streetlamps - being all of mundane,
modern design; none of the elegant Victorian replicas have carried over to
this portion of the city - are burned out or yellowed, buzzing sources of
light, often flickering on and off to leave anyone below in complete
darkness.  The occasional car creeps by, and from time to time a lone
individual can be seen settling down against the wall of an old shot-gun
styled building.  Just to the east, Esplanade Avenue runs north to south. 
The entrance to the#e Lamplighter Bar#n lies to the south.

#pThe New Orleans City Strip, South Canal St.#n~
The street has three lanes of traffic in both directions, with a pair of
streetcar tracks running down the center.  Canal Street's downtown segment
serves as the hub of the city's mass transit system, with numerous streetcar
and bus line terminals on the roadsides.  Often said to be the widest
roadway in America to be classified as a street, it is an excessively wide
urban thoroughfare.  Classic iron wrought lamps run two lines down the
center island; their muted glow blends with the dazzling electric lights of
the department stores, restaurants, government buildings and myriad of other
businesses populating the strip.  There are a few palm trees jutting up out
of the sidewalks.  Billboards and flatscreens loom over the streets from the
sides and rooftops of vast skyscrapers, blinking and flashing
advertisements.  The glitz and glam of the nearby French Quarter is
lingering yet brittle; the strip reminds more of just another city.  Traffic

Plaza Tower#n, a vacant forty-five story landmark on the New Orleans
skyline, sits east off Canal Street inside a large, flat parking area. 
Though empty and dark, access to the tower is not barred.

`bNorth Rampart Street (Avg. NPCs: 2)`n~
Far removed from it's southern brothers, North Rampart Street bears no
real nightlife, no party-goers, and no tourists; what people there are
travel in clusters, huddling close to one another around barrels filled with
burning debris, or moving quick by the mouths of narrow alleyways reeking of
vomit, urine and worse.  The majority of streetlamps - being all of mundane,
modern design; none of the elegant Victorian replicas have carried over to
this portion of the city - are burned out or yellowed, buzzing sources of
light, often flickering on and off to leave anyone below in complete
darkness.  The occasional car creeps by, and from time to time a lone
individual can be seen settling down against the wall of an old shot-gun
styled building.  The large shutter door of #oClaude Bean's Body Shop#n 
can be seen north.

#pThe New Orleans City Strip, South Canal St.#n~
The street has three lanes of traffic in both directions, with a pair of
streetcar tracks running down the center.  Canal Street's downtown segment
serves as the hub of the city's mass transit system, with numerous streetcar
and bus line terminals on the roadsides.  Often said to be the widest
roadway in America to be classified as a street, it is an excessively wide
urban thoroughfare.  Classic iron wrought lamps run two lines down the
center island; their muted glow blends with the dazzling electric lights of
the department stores, restaurants, government buildings and myriad of other
businesses populating the strip.  There are a few palm trees jutting up out
of the sidewalks.  Billboards and flatscreens loom over the streets from the
sides and rooftops of vast skyscrapers, blinking and flashing
advertisements.  The glitz and glam of the nearby French Quarter is
lingering yet brittle; the strip reminds more of just another city.  Traffic
is thick as molasses, both vehicular and pedestrian, night or day.  Pale
green singles tile the many-tiered roof of the #GHangzhou Teahouse#n; a
large arbor draped with softly glowing electric roses leads through the
large wood door on the west side of the street.  Dark, smooth teal pillars
with pale hardwood paneling and modern sheet windows greet and invite
passing pedestrians into #CAnthropologie#n, a top-end store for Urban
Outfitter apparel, gifts and furnishings.

#pBoardwalk along the Mississippi (Avg. NPCs: 4)#n~
The muddy waters of the Mississippi are black by night.  The industrial
boom shaped the skyline and compromised much of the view many decades before
modern nights, but there are still places where one can stop by the rail and
look over the river, unaffected by the urban decay that strains to obscure
it.  Barge horns remind those within hearing distance that the water exists
with long, mournful calls.  The boardwalk is shadowed by the tangle of
factories, cranes and warehouses crowding the shoreline.  Glass panes form
the eastern wall of #oStarbucks Coffee#n, a posh and unexpected caress on
the face of the waterfront.  The cafe doubles as an entrance to Canal Place
Shopping Center.

#pLafayette Square on the City Strip, South Canal St.#n~
Traffic rolls around the square into four directions, two leading up and
down South Canal Street and two back and forth down St.  Peter.  In every
direction the glittering spires of skyscrapers create a jagged skyline. 
This is the second oldest square in New Orleans, designed in 1788 by Charles
Laveau Trudeau and named after a French aristocrat who fought with the
Americans in the Revolutionary War.  A bronze statue of Henry Clay sits at
the center of the square with a grassy hedge crafted around the inscripted
base.  Framing the park are the bright faces of historical Gallier Hall and
the former City Hall.  All around are magnolia trees, cypress and oak. 
Brown granite bollards flank the walkways connected by heavy chain.  The
Square has been the site for inaugurations, yearly pilgrimages by school
bands, and jazz concerts for over 150 years.  Of all the parks in New
Orleans this one sees the most action after nightfall; set in the middle of
the city center it remains well-lit and well-traveled at all hours.

alley smelling faintly of rubbish.

#eAn alley connecting Julia to S. Canal St.#n~
Tall skyscrapers rise up on either side of the alley, casting the whole
place into shadow.  Streetlight filters through either end, stretching its
warm fingers into the darkness, but never quite deep enough; brick and stone
walls give off a chill that fills the alley, despite the humidity.  Amidst
all the noise there is something about this place that seems quiet.  Traffic
on either end of the alley blare their horns all through the day or night. 
The sound reverberates in the close confines of the alley.  Several rats
scatter across the floor clearing out of a pile of trash near the center. 
There are several dumpsters pushed against the walls and an abandoned
Volkswagon Beetle with a burned, hollowed interior.

`gChartres Street (Avg. NPCs: 0)`n~
This wide street is all but wholly abandoned after nightfall, leaving the
majority of traffic solely to the occasional car that creeps through,
headlights always off, so as not to disturb the intenteded feel of antiqued
suffocation.  Cypress and willow trees have been left to overgrow, and
heavy, thick branches hang down over the street, obscuring even the moon and
starlight to a barely present, dim source of illumination.  Absolutely no
cars are parked on Chartres, and by all counts it appears to be almost
wholly abandoned.  No lights are on in the windows of the lobbies of the
various hotels, all businesses appear to be closed - apartment flats have
boarded up windows and the enclosures about the Spanish styled courtyards
that encircle each private villa show clear signs of disuse in broken and
rusted locks, vines growing wild and various debris.  Mostly empty pots
dangle from the balconies that layer the front of most buildings, the few
still living plants offering the only discernable tamed greenery.

#CBienville Avenue#n~
The streets are packed with the faces of buildings that range in height
from single-story corner shops and cafes to several dozen floored office
buildings, banks, hotels, and apartment buildings.  Bienville is narrow,
allowing two cars to pass at a stretch if no one is parked on the
streetsides, and someone almost always is.  Much of the older Bienville was
designed in art deco and a great deal of that architecture survives. 
Classic iron wrought streetlamps run up one side of the street but leave the
other in darkness.  Narrow alleys vein the rare spaces between structures,
reeking with urine and rot.  The highlight of Bienville is arguably the
old-growth cypress tree that juts up between a tourist trap voodoo shop and
a seedy little nightclub.  Branches dripping with Spanish Moss are visible
from anywhere on Bienville Street.

dangle from the balconies that layer the front of most buildings, the few
still living plants offering the only discernable tamed greenery.

#CBienville Avenue#n~
The streets are packed with the faces of buildings that range in height
from single-story corner shops and cafes to several dozen floored office
buildings, banks, hotels, and apartment buildings.  Bienville is narrow,
allowing two cars to pass at a stretch if no one is parked on the
streetsides, and someone almost always is.  Much of the older Bienville was
designed in art deco and a great deal of that architecture survives. 
Classic iron wrought streetlamps run up one side of the street but leave the
other in darkness.  Narrow alleys vein the rare spaces between structures,
reeking with urine and rot.  The highlight of Bienville is arguably the
old-growth cypress tree that juts up between a tourist trap voodoo shop and
a seedy little nightclub.  Branches dripping with Spanish Moss are visible
from anywhere on Bienville Street.  With a pub on the ground floor and the
iron wrap-around balcony on the residence up top, the #gPig and Whistle#n
pub lies to the north beneath a vertical sign that hangs off the front of
the building over the sidewalk.

`gChartres Street (Avg. NPCs: 0)`n~
This wide street is all but wholly abandoned after nightfall, leaving the
majority of traffic solely to the occasional car that creeps through,
headlights always off, so as not to disturb the intenteded feel of antiqued
suffocation.  Cypress and willow trees have been left to overgrow, and
heavy, thick branches hang down over the street, obscuring even the moon and
starlight to a barely present, dim source of illumination.  Absolutely no
cars are parked on Chartres, and by all counts it appears to be almost

dangle from the balconies that layer the front of most buildings, the few
still living plants offering the only discernable tamed greenery.  The
`bSaint Sophia Cathedral`n, an abandoned frame of cracked vine and moss
choked dark stones with it's stained glass windows boarded up from the
outside, lies to the north, it's spire managing to catch the attention of
the eye, while all else is obscured behind modern structures.

`eThe Intersection of Chartres and Toulouse (Avg. NPCs: 10)`n~
Outside of the sparse stores of Toulouse Street, the street lamps are
well-maintained and their light is of an illuminating white; however,
between, before, and after the collective body of public storefronts there
are very few that work correctly, and many that refuse to at all, leaving a
good third of the narrow slash through the city in darkness.  The sidewalks
are of an old, smooth, and occasionally cracked stone of a dark grey hue;
broken up in many places by iron grills or sewer lids which lazily let out
clouds of steam into the air like sleeping dragons beneath the paving slabs.
Unlit balconies peer down from above; watch points for the fearful or the
fearless whom care to observe the darkened street below.

No other city in the United States has two and even three-story iron
porches and balconies that can compare with those of New Orleans.  Some of
these lacy structures, such as those on St.  Peter Street, were built above
the sidewalks, where balconies sometimes not only extend across an entire
facade but continue around corners.  St.  Peter Street has an almost theme
parkish appearance, with buildings that appear squat against the backdrop of
towering skyscrapers and the packed solid urban landscape of Metairie.  A
post office is one of the few official buildings on the block, with the
majority of places filled with permanent residents in quaint shotgun style
homes.  Classic iron wrought streetlamps flank the street on both sides.

`rRoyal Street (Avg. NPCs: 5)`n~
Royal Street is undoubtedly one of the more policed areas of the French
Quarter, such being made evident simply by the average wealth of those whom
populate the street; yuppies, oldies and the guy who knew how to smile as he
killed.  Elegant wrought-iron posts encase bright, clear lamps along both
opposing sidewalks, spread apart by dotted trees and bollards in perfect
lines, almost as if the pavement was designed to keep undesirable things
out, or in.  The buildings range in both size and shape, though they are all
cleanly and respectable as a rule; however, as wealthy as the street is,
there are still elements of the decrepit city outside of its borders;
half-dead bums sleeping rough against cleaned dumpsters and the dealer the
inhabitants know by name.  Hookers patrol regularly, but if you're buying,
expect to be set back several hundred.  The black and white awning hanging
over #pZ'Otz Coffee and Tea House#n's sliding glass door lies to the south;
the building is composed of brown, white and grey stones in imperfect
circular shapes, and the sign is glowing white neon on a cast iron black
background, hanging above the awning over Royal Street.

The mark is an endless knot in the shape of a penticle, wreathed by what

#GHangzhou Teahouse#n~
The inside of the large room is bustling with activity.  The blue tiled
floor and green tiled walls are if anything a little dated and worn.  Some
tiles either chipped or worn away leaving it with a distinctly less than
classy edge.  The main room itself is laid out with several booths about the
edges and various tables in the centre, while along the one wall a long
counter runs through which the kitchen can be seen.  From the kitchen clouds
of steam can be seen erupting from pans and large pots which teeter
uncermoniously upon the hob, an entire array of spices and scents can be
almost tasted in the air from the kitchen alone.  While out in the main
seating area the gentle clink and clatter of chinaware can be heard as tea
is poured back and forth between tables.  The many varied scents from
earthy, citrus and other fruity teas arise from the cluttered tables above
which hang bird cages of all sizes and kinds, each filled with a birds of
disparate colours and size.  The constant varied birdsong fills the room
alongside the chatter of friends, the clatter of china and the clink of
cutlery.  The booths themselves are mostly cheap affairs, comfortable enough
imitation black leather but nothing too spectacular and likewise the tables
themselves are mostly plastic coated and the chairs simply wooden.  The
lighting is distinctly flourescent with more than a couple of the long
tubular lights flickering and casting their harsh annoying glare throughout
the room.  Even during the daytime hours, the windows that gaze out into the
street are shrouded by blinds that obstruct most of the natural light from
the outside.

#gAn old-growth cypress in a Downtown Alley (Decay Loci)#n~
Thick ropes of woody roots have cracked through the asphalt of the alley
and sculpted the floor into ragged potholes.  The buildings that sandwich in
the space are pushed forcefully against by vast branches dripping with
Spanish Moss, like arms struggling to shove aside two captors wearing ragged
sleeves.  The tree rises high into the skyline and blots out the streetlight
from Bienville Street.  Bits of wet garbage paper the ground.  The alley
affords space for several people to occupy at once.

thoroughly antiqued film temple.  A crying room, glass-enclosed behind the
back row, sits just past the hardwood lobby.  Finally succumbing to the
competition from megaplexes with stadium-style seating and a dozen or more
screens, the Joy Theater stopped selling blockbuster movie tickets and
started down the road of culture classics just a handful of years ago.  The
opera boxes are filled most nights by lounging young people smoking
cigarettes and drinking from the glass beer bottles sold in the lobby, and
the crushed red velvet seats below with all sorts of patronage.  The theater
plays shows all day, but the real money-grabber is the midnight showing of
Rocky Horror Picture Show.  Costumed customers throw playing cards, shoot
water guns and fling toast several nights of the month, shouting baudy catch
phrases at the massive screen.

`rRoyal Street (Avg. NPCs: 5)`n~
Royal Street is undoubtedly one of the more policed areas of the French
Quarter, such being made evident simply by the average wealth of those whom
populate the street; yuppies, oldies and the guy who knew how to smile as he
killed.  Elegant wrought-iron posts encase bright, clear lamps along both
opposing sidewalks, spread apart by dotted trees and bollards in perfect
lines, almost as if the pavement was designed to keep undesirable things
out, or in.  A constant busy area, this portion of Royal Street is packed
with law enforcement officials, their vehicles and even their animal officer
counterparts.  The precinct itself sits just to the south with a large stone
archway labeled `BNew Orleans Police Department`n used for the entrance. 
The buildings range in both size and shape, though they are all cleanly and
respectable as a rule; however, as wealthy as the street is, there are still
elements of the decrepit city outside of its borders; half-dead bums
sleeping rough against cleaned dumpsters and the dealer the inhabitants know
by name.  Hookers patrol regularly, but if you're buying, expect to be set
back several hundred.

#rThe Spanish Plaza#n~
A cement half-wall divides St.  Ann Street from the Spanish Plaza; fitted
with pastel tiles, thirteen mosiac pictures depict symbols of Spain, France,
and the city itself, from fleur-de-lis to roses.  Spain dedicated this plaza
in 1976 to the City of New Orleans in remembrance of their common historical
past and as a pledge of fraternity in the future.  At it's focal point is a
fountain surrounded by the seals of the provinces of Spain.  Walking up a
wide set of paved stairs the plaza opens toward Lake Pontchartrain, which
shares a border with St.  Ann.  Quarter operated telescopes look over the
rippling waters and on a clear night can see all the way to the Mandeville
lighthouse on the northern shore.  A tall iron arbor allows passage from the
wood plaza to a short dock that juts over the lake.  A few old-growth oaks
ring the plaza.

#cBon Ton Cafe <Avg. NPCs: 23>#n~
The flickering gas light and canvas canopy frame the distressed red paint
of the front door, which sits fully open all through the night.  Within
earshot of boat whistles on the Mississippi, the Bon Ton's checkered red and
white table cloths, wrought-iron chandeliers and soft-brick walls create a
special atmosphere to enjoy Lafourche and Terrebonne Parish Cajun food
prepared stylishly from original family recipes.  The Bon Ton's ambience and
cuisine flow from the uncrushable joie de vivre of the Cajun people,
offering all the humble foods the bayou wilderness has to offer, smoothed
and polished into something that resembles fine dining.  Open since the
early 1900's, it has been more than a hundred years since the cafe doors
truly closed.  The main attraction of the dining area is the absolutely
massive crocodile, prepared expertly with taxidermy, that hangs from the
rafters in an attitude of swimming.

`oBourbon Street (Avg. NPCs: 202)`n~
The heavy reek of sweat, vomit and less savoury human wastes are well
present on this world famous stretch of land, filled with tightly packed
hordes of tourists, bars, glittering strings of beads and more than an ample
share of nudity.  The gutters that border the wide old sidewalks on either
side of the thickly populated street are filled with a layer of various
squelching liquids; anything dropped onto the ground here is better left
where it lies.  Cheap, potent alcoholic drinks fill almost every hand, and
people kneel or flop onto the cobblestones to empty their stomachs almost
everywhere one chooses to look.  A thousand sources of music in various
genres - though heavy, often soothing jazz is in the majority - pours out
the open doors of clubs and bars.  Buzzing, neon lit signs are mounted above
the doors of the seemingly endless supply of strip joints.  The often
massive statures of bouncers are as frequent a sight as half naked
strippers, lingering on the stoops of their affiliated clubs.

#pCafe Nuange <Avg. NPCs: 9>#n~
Aging brick walls lined with dull wood shelves rise up two dozen feet to
the lofted ceiling.  Exposed beams with visible dust dangling like lace
support the roof.  No two tables or chairs match, but they were all once
made of wood that have been covered top to bottom over the decades with
hand-written drawings, messages and signatures.  Dates on some of the
graffiti assign authors from as early as the 1930's.  The bar is chest high
and charmingly battered, with a glass roll-top section for displaying
pastries and muffins.  Coffee, espresso and latte are the words on every
customer's lips, with no other specifications than that; there are no sizes
and nothing fancier served.  Shakers with cinnamon and sugar, a glass jar
containing honey and a round tool to gather dollops at a time, and a ceramic
pot that chills cream are provided on the far end of the bar, where finished
drinks are set out for customers.  There are no portable cups - just a
thrift-store collection of generous ceramic mugs.  The double doors leading
back onto the crowded city strip are copper plated with glass.

#rThe vacant lobby of Plaza Tower#n~
The third tallest building in the state of Louisiana and one of the most
iconic on the New Orleans strip with its mushroom top and generous skydeck,
Plaza Tower has sat vacant due to environmental problems such as toxic mold
and asbestos since 2002.  Several companies have purchased the building with
plans to remediate, but one way or another these plans fall through and
leave the building's future unknown.  In the lobby the carpet has been
pulled up to expose smooth cement, and the walls and ceilings have been
stripped to leave a bare bones skeleton.  The elevator has been outdated for
decades and out of service for longer.  The staircase is still accessible
through an unlocked fire door, and it is visible through the open ceiling at
four floors up into the building.

The staircase is sturdy and each step is paved with smooth cement.  There
is a railing provided on one side and an external wall on the other, no
matter which way the steps turn.  The interior walls of several of the Plaza
Tower's stories have been stripped down to a bare bones steel skeleton, and
the flooring is broken up and let to drop into the empty lobby below in big
chunks.  Signs of construction linger in the yellow caution tape that wraps
around the railing all the way to the forty-fifth floor, reminding anyone
who isn't already aware that there is nothing to stand on should they try to
leave the stairs.  At the very top a fire door sits unlocked, opening onto
the Plaza skydeck.  The floor of the skydeck appears to be intact.

#rSkydeck of the Plaza Tower#n~
The view from the skydeck is dazzling.  All memory of the vacant building
below, the risks involved in climbing the staircase, the absent floors and
broken walls below fade to nothing as the sparkling landscape of urban New
Orleans stretches out lazily before you.  The entire city is visible from
here, and in the darkness every light, every tiny bulb on every building and
vehicle below is a gleaming gem against a black backdrop.  To the south the
rolling currents of the Mississippi River split a ribbon between the French
Quarter and the carnival lights of distant steamboats, to the north the city
sprawl presses up against the dark waters of Lake Pontchartrain.  The
distant whistles and bells of barges and boats carry through the air with
the gentle lapping of water on the shoreline.  In spite of the noise of
traffic and people far on the ground below this is a quiet place, almost
peaceful.  A single quarter operated telescope is mounted on the edge of the
mushroom shaped skydeck.

Filled by no fewer than a hundred cars on the slowest nights, the parking
lot spans across several paved acres, cutting around varied complexes of
multifloored buildings.  The medical center is a colossal construct of brown
adobe and plate glass, with a large dome over the lobby and six revolving
doors.  The Emergency Room is set off to the side of the main building,
running up a narrow causeway to an aluminium awning where ambulances can be
parked for quick unloading.  Signs posted outside each door on every
building enforce the No Smoking policy on medical center grounds.

The tiled floor is bright and patterned like sunbursts, the lighting warm
and personal, and the ceilings high, supported by exposed beams of red wood.
Two floors connect with sleek escalators that run customers up and down,
from apparel to home furnishings and gifts.  Each department has a unique
flair and theme of decor; the bottom floor is dedicated to clothing, heaving
a wave of seasonal colors, well-dressed model mannequins and tasteful
decorations at the consumer.  The top floor follows a similar theme,
matching the season in color and decor and boasting full displays of living
rooms, bedrooms, and bathrooms fitted with Free Peoples design goods.  The
staff are markedly attractive and solely female; dressed in Urban Outiffer
with gold nametags, they are living advertisements that walk and talk. 
Through the sheet glass windows the bustling streets of the Metairie crowd
the view.  People leaving with glossy bags filled with purchases mingle with
the empty-handed newcomers.

`eThe Intersection of Bourbon and Toulouse (Avg. NPCs: 50)`n~
Outside of the sparse stores of Toulouse Street, the street lamps are
well-maintained and their light is of an illuminating white; however,
between, before, and after the collective body of public storefronts there
are very few that work correctly, and many that refuse to at all, leaving a
good third of the narrow slash through the city in darkness.  The sidewalks
are of an old, smooth, and occasionally cracked stone of a dark grey hue;
broken up in many places by iron grills or sewer lids which lazily let out
clouds of steam into the air like sleeping dragons beneath the paving slabs.
Unlit balconies peer down from above; watch points for the fearful or the
fearless whom care to observe the darkened street below.

#eThe Metairie Cemetery#n~
With the largest collection of elaborate marble tombs and funeral
statuary in New Orleans, Metairie should probably be a more popular spot for
tourists to invade; whether it's the disrepair of the unsettling prickling
on the back of the neck upon stepping through the iron gates, something
keeps these casual interlopers away.  Some of the most remarkable tombs are
named, but most are not.  One such tombs is The Army of Tennessee, a
monumental burial of Confederate soldiers of the American civil war,
boasting two notable works by sculptor Alexander Doyle; the equestrian
statue of General Albert Sidney Johnston on his horse "Fire Eater", holding
binoculars in his right hand, and a life-size statue of a Confederate
officer about to read the roll of the dead positioned to the right of the
tomb.  A pseudo-Egyptian pyramid made of pale marble stands near the rear
wall of the grounds, not far from the Moriarty tomb - a marble monument with
a height of sixty feet that required a temporary spur railroad line to bring
in the materials used to build it.  The tomb of Storyville madam Josie
Arlington is delicately done in white and rose granite, and the memorial of
19th century police chief David Hennessy, whose murder sparked a riot, is
one of the best tended plots.  Hundreds of notables are buried amongst the
dour-faced angels and statues of kneeling children, placed around a grid of
grass and tomb-lined walkways.

check-in.  There is a surprisingly low level of noise, for all of the people
who are in here.  The floor is white tile, and the ceiling is off-white
acoustical tile, with rows of flourescent lights.  To the north is the
examining room hallway.  To the northeast is the waiting room, for patients'
families.  To the west is the elevator.  On either side of the main entrance
there are tall windows, covered in white mini-blinds.

A cozy neighborhood pub with a central bar made of old polished cypress. 
The ornate Celtic knot wrought-iron bars covering the stained glass windows
make for interesting patterns on the floor when the streetlight shines in

around the bar and the room.  The walls are paneled with photos of sports
stars and actors that have stopped in for a pint.  The bar is fully stocked.
Mirrored shelves display the variety of liquors available.  Dotting the room
are tables of various sizes.  The kitchen and rest rooms are along the back
of the pub.  During the day the business is mostly made up of blue collar
workers having lunch and a few regular bar-flies, but at night it can get a
bit crowded, every seat filled and table occupied.

`rDauphin Street (Avg. NPCs: 4)`n~
Dauphin Street offers a simplistic mix of homes, shops and cafes that are
closed by night, either by swing-down locking iron grates, bars on the
windows or more sophisticated measures.  Just one street from Bourbon, the
constant, violent echo of party goers, drug addicts and drunks is present as
a dull white-noise roar.  Parked cars line either side of the street in all
states of function, some grown over with vines and covered in a thick layer
of dust, some quite polished and clean.  A few parking lots turn off the

`wPort of Call`n, just to the south.

#cDea#g Maris#e, Lobby (Avg. NPCs: 2)#n~
Stepping off of the sidewalks of Julia Street, the lobby of Dea Maris is
like wandering into a small section of forest cut out from the wilderness
far outside the concrete jungle.  The walls are a soft, soothing shade of
sage and the flooring is a darker, earthy emerald.  A few chairs are set up
as a waiting area, their rich leathers stained green.  Along the walls are a
collection of different plants which convey a feeling of purity, as the air
is more crisp here than outside of the building.  By the back wall is a
rounded, organic desk of the same, deep ebony-green marble stone as the
flooring.  Behind the front desk is a circular window of stained glass,
depicting the serene expression of a classical female figure.  Her hair is
flowing around her face like waves, the glass a mixture of swirling navy and
jade.  To the north of the room, beside the desk, is a frosted glass door
with a golden handle, a sign above the door reading "Spa."  To the west of
the lush room is another frosted doorway with a golden handle, the sign
above it reading "Meditation Room."

`rDauphin Street (Avg. NPCs: 4)`n~
Dauphin Street offers a simplistic mix of homes, shops and cafes that are
closed by night, either by swing-down locking iron grates, bars on the
windows or more sophisticated measures.  Just one street from Bourbon, the
constant, violent echo of party goers, drug addicts and drunks is present as
a dull white-noise roar.  Parked cars line either side of the street in all
states of function, some grown over with vines and covered in a thick layer
of dust, some quite polished and clean.  A few parking lots turn off the
main street.

#cDea#g Maris#e, Meditation Room~
The contrast of light from the lobby to the western room of the
Meditation area is stark.  From earthy greens before, the room now is of
deeper, darker colors of burnt sienna and mahogany.  The floor was richer,
more chocolate hued sandstone, blanketed in sections with soft throw rugs,
and along the walls are a collection of plush pillows.  Incense and heated
oils fill the room with a thick screen of herbal and floral smells, both
soothing and relaxing to any patron that spent their time here.  The roof of
the room has a tinted skylight box, which during the day allowed in dulled,
honey light, and by night, allowed an open space to the sky above.  Against
a back wall is a statue of a woman with flowing hair and robes.  Her arms
held a large, open mouthed urn that was tipped forward, water poured from it
freely and into the basin around her feet, creating a pool.  The sound
created a trickling stream effect to ease the area with natural white noise.

`eThe Intersection of Dauphin and Ursulines (Avg. NPCs: 1)`n~
The Intersection of Dauphin and Ursulines offers a nice mix of homes,
shops and cafes.  Being just one street away from Bourbon however, the
constant sounds of party goers and drunks echoes throughout the street. 
Parked cars for those venturing one street down, causes the street to be
just wide enough for a car to pass.  This street is often used mostly for a
quick and easy parking spot for those desiring to tour the rest of the
French Quarter.

#cDea#g Maris#e, Spa~
After exiting the forest-like atmosphere of the lobby, the Spa area is a
large, open section of building surrounding a deep pool in its center.  The
flooring is a cream-colored sandstone that hugs the edges of the deep pool
of water, marked off with golden tile work and then deeper down is a mosaic
of waves created with navy, sapphire and ebony squares.  Within the wave
pattern of the pool bottom is the hidden figure of a beautiful, liquid
created woman.  Off to the sides of the pool are eight stalls, four on each
side, used for massage areas.  Drapes of imperial blue act as doors when in
use, and when open, they are held off by golden rope, pulling them to one
side.  The sandstone continues to the rear of the room where a set of dual
stalls can be seen.  The markers above the doors read "Lady" and "Lord,"
signifying that the stalls are changing rooms.  Another larger stone-covered
door is in another corner of the room, the marker reading "Sauna" over its
glass entrance.

#wSoren Christensen#n Gallery#n~
Inside the red brick building opens a space reminiscent of a warehouse. 
The windows are old plate glass, uniformly placed on the open-air second and
first floors.  The walls are painted stark white, the floor tiled in white,
and the gallery rows also white.  These blanched backdrops support many
vibrant colors; contemporary paintings, sculpture, and photography by
national and international artists that pop against the paleness of the
gallery structure.  Spotlights on long steel poles hang down from the open
ceiling, blooming crisp beacons of light onto the art floor.  Several rows
are formed by temporary walls that can be rearranged to accomodate statuary
or displays of any size.  Benches are placed here and there to allow
potential buyers or simply admirers to sit and gaze at a preferred piece. 
The benches are, in following theme, white wood with white cushions.

#BBlue Cypress Books (Avg. NPCs: 11)#n~
The walls are painted a fresh robin's egg blue with accents of cheerful
yellow and brick running up the corners, showing the foundation of the
building underneath.  Shelves of a light-weight pale wood form five aisles,
segregating one portion of the store to browsing for the books that fill
them.  The front window is large and covers most of the building's face,
reading 'Blue Cypress Books' in a fun hand-painted font, blue outlined in
white; the familiar blue cypress tree is painted on after the word 'blue',
and on the half-dome shape top of the window reads 'buy - sell - trade' in
the same hand-painted font.  Squat tables from any number of collections are
arranged through the more open half of the room, many with deco flowers
painted on their folding leaves.  A few groups cluster around these tables
in mismatching chairs, reading and debating what they read.  Many people
browse the shelves on their own, buying or going to find a solitary seat
somewhere in the shop to read.  Coupons for free Z'Otz Coffee and Tea are
handed out at the counter for making certain purchases on certain days,
following a definite theme in time with local, national and world events;
during times of crisis with China buying a book on Taoism or Chinese culture
might get a customer a free drink, or while debates rage about stem-cell
research a book on genetics or biology might.  The floor is a pale hard wood
and many framed pictures of any old random thing line the walls in no
particular order.

Two settings of white tables and chairs have been placed outside the shop 
under a crimson canvas awning for customers to sit.  Resting on an iron 
stand nearby is a large wicker basket filled with plain loaves of bread.  
A plastic-wrapped notice is clipped together with the basket.

#pMain grounds of an antebellum mansion~
A broad expanse of lush, manicured lawn surrounds the house on three
sides, with the back closed off by a walled garden.  A winding cobblestone
driveway meanders through the grounds before passing in front of the mansion
and then continuing to the converted carriage house on the west side of the
building that now serves as a garage.  Mature trees, their branches heavy
with Spanish moss are scattered about the grounds, with the occasional
wrought iron bench situated beneath to take advantage of the shade.  Several
small black domes have been strategically placed in amongst the trees and
lawn, each protecting a security camera within.  The house itself is a
recently restored antebellum mansion featuring six Corinthian columns along
the front facade flanking a set of wide granite steps that lead to the front
doors, and a terrace that runs along the second floor.

`eThe Intersection of Dauphin and Toulouse (Avg. NPCs: 10)`n~
Outside of the sparse stores of Toulouse Street, the street lamps are
well-maintained and their light is of an illuminating white; however,
between, before, and after the collective body of public storefronts there
are very few that work correctly, and many that refuse to at all, leaving a
good third of the narrow slash through the city in darkness.  The sidewalks
are of an old, smooth, and occasionally cracked stone of a dark grey hue;
broken up in many places by iron grills or sewer lids which lazily let out
clouds of steam into the air like sleeping dragons beneath the paving slabs.
Unlit balconies peer down from above; watch points for the fearful or the
fearless whom care to observe the darkened street below.

This grand entryway features a high, vaulted ceiling with a sweeping
staircase carpeted in plush crimson dominating the south side of the room. 
A massive chandelier exquisitely crafted in gold with crystal accents is
suspended from the ceiling and fills the space with soft illumination.  The
onyx marble floor gleams sullenly below, as if daring a speck of dirt or
dust to try and take purchase upon its immaculate surface.  Heavy velvet
curtains in deep crimson flank the tall windows, and two archways surrounded
by intricate molding lead off to the east and west, providing access to the
parlour and formal dining room.  A single door to the south, half-hidden by
the staircase leads to the servants' wing of the house.

#gGarden behind an antebellum mansion#n~
Located at the rear of the mansion and enclosed by a high stone wall, the
garden exudes the same obsessively neat ambience as the rest of the
property.  The grass is perfectly manicured, providing a lush green carpet
for those who feel the need to step off the winding stone pathways. 
Flowering trees and vines fill the air with their sweet perfume, though
every branch is neatly trimmed and not a single weed dares try and take
purchase within the flower beds.  In the center of the garden, a covered
gazebo provides shelter in inclement weather, and granite benches are placed
at intervals along the winding pathway allowing quiet places to rest. 
Throughout the garden, finely carved marble statues depicting benevolent
angels and rather ferocious looking demons keep silent vigils over the
shadowy space.

depiction of two symmetrical lions, their jaws ferociously agape, either
side of a clan crest and crown.  Scrolled beneath them is a latin
inscription; Regere Sanguine Regere In Veritatem Est.

Packed on all sides with chipped-brick apartment buildings that cast long
shadows across the narrow, Cypress choked road, Burgundy is a solely
residential area, neither rich nor poor, thus displaying a dizzying meld of
both run-down structures, cracked sidewalks and aging shotgun homes blended
in with one-story Parisian condos and their enclosed courtyards.  Granite
gargoyles top wrought iron fences, looming strategically overhead with their
twisted faces turned into malicious grimaces.  Black iron, intricate
balconies line the apartment complexes, occasionally holding some personal
effect of the residents, though the majority are empty and dark, mere
open-faced pods by the thousands where people can stand or sit to watch the
goings on below.  Jasmine and vines grow thick, pushing wild through the
sidewalks and suffocating the lesser maintained of buildings.  The gutters
are filled with their share of litter, and the tall, gothic-Victorian
streetlamps from an age where gas, not electricity, was used to illuminate
them have never been modified to suit the modern age, lying dark and filled
with cobwebs instead of bulbs.

#pMaster Bedroom#n~
A larger and more luxurious version of the guest suites in the house, the
master bedroom is in fact three rooms connected by arched doorways.  The
sitting room is spacious enough to comfortably hold at least a dozen people,
though it is unlikely the Mistress of the House has entertained quite so
many visitors in her boudoir at one time.  A vibrantly coloured and
obviously authentic Persian rug lies in the middle of the white marble
floor, and intricately crafted silver wall sconces provide muted lighting. 
Two white leather love seats and a pair of matching armchairs form a cozy
conversation area in front of the large fireplace which has been cleverly
retrofitted with an LCD display that does an impressive job of creating the
warm ambience of a fire without the actual flames.  Through the archway to
the north, a king sized bed swathed in onyx silk can be glimpsed, giving a
good idea of the purpose for that room, and to the south, a peek into the
bathroom reveals a two person hot tub in addition to the usual amenities.

matching armchair as well as a small wet bar in one corner of the room. 
French doors open onto a small private balcony that overlooks the western
side of the grounds, and doors to the north and south grant access to the
well-appointed bedroom and bathroom respectively.  As in the rest of the

wrinkle in the linens no matter how frequently the rooms are occupied.

features very little in the way of aesthetics, other than a few small
touches.  Plush crimson carpeting covers the floor, and two small occasional
tables rest opposite each other halfway down the hallway, holding vases of
fresh flowers while brass sconces along the walls provide muted lighting. 
Mahogany doors grant access to the kitchen and the rooms belonging to the
household staff and a set of French doors at the far end of the hallway
leads to the rear garden.

This corner room is larger than most in the servant's wing of the house. 
The large four poster bed takes center stage in the room and is covered with
a powder blue duvet and at least a dozen pillows in various shades of blue. 
The gossamer netting hanging from the canopy are of a soft blue as well. 
The hardwood floors are covered with a large oriental rug that lies directly
beneath the bed.  On the south wall a large set of French doors leads out
onto a small loggia overlooking the gardens behind the house.  The west wall
holds a small bay window and a seating area with a fainting couch in the
same blue motif as the bed, but with gold thread accents throughout.  The
requisite chifferobe and vanity grace the north wall on either side of a
pocket door that leads to a private bath.

`pBurgundy Street (Avg. NPCs: 2)`n~
Packed on all sides with chipped-brick apartment buildings that cast long
shadows across the narrow, Cypress choked road, Burgundy is a solely
residential area, neither rich nor poor, thus displaying a dizzying meld of
both run-down structures, cracked sidewalks and aging shotgun homes blended
in with one-story Parisian condos and their enclosed courtyards.  Granite
gargoyles top wrought iron fences, looming strategically overhead with their
twisted faces turned into malicious grimaces.  Black iron, intricate
balconies line the apartment complexes, occasionally holding some personal
effect of the residents, though the majority are empty and dark, mere
open-faced pods by the thousands where people can stand or sit to watch the
goings on below.  Jasmine and vines grow thick, pushing wild through the
sidewalks and suffocating the lesser maintained of buildings.  The gutters
are filled with their share of litter, and the tall, gothic-Victorian
streetlamps from an age where gas, not electricity, was used to illuminate
them have never been modified to suit the modern age, lying dark and filled
with cobwebs instead of bulbs.

#pParlour#n~
Many a fabulous soiree have been held in this spacious room, though like
the rest of the house, it does not have a 'lived in' look to it at all.  The
onyx marble floor continues from the foyer, and nary a scuff mark or trace
of dust mars its gleaming surface.  The furniture is clearly expensive;
soft, black leather couches and armchairs flanked by glass-topped occasional
tables and from the apparent condition of the pieces, they are either rarely
used, or more likely, often replaced.  A grand piano sits in the southwest
corner of the room, and several curio cabinets hold delicate objets d'art,
though overall there is an overwhelming minimalist feel to the decor.  The
foyer, and the rest of the house can be accessed through the archway to the
west, and a mahogany door in the center of the north wall leads to a private
study.

#pStudy#n~
As sterile and obsessively clean as the rest of the house, this study
does not exactly have a homey feel to it.  The hardwood floor always appears
freshly waxed, and although the massive mahogany desk that dominates the
north side of the study has a large surface area, it is never cluttered with
papers or books.  A high backed leather chair rests behind the desk, with
two smaller chairs set on the opposite side for visitors.  Floor-to-ceiling
bookshelves line the walls, and not surprisingly, there is not a speck of
dust to be seen on any of the leather-bound tomes that rest within.

#pAccess Shaft#n~
A set of narrow steps spiral around the length of the reinforced steel
shaft that descends fifteen feet below the house.  At the top of the
cylinder, a steel plate blocks access to the study beyond and there appears
to be no mechanism within the shaft for opening it.  At the bottom, the
shaft takes a right angle, extending another six feet or so to the east
before ending at a heavy steel door with a lighted keypad and fingerprint
sensor mounted beside it.  Several cameras are mounted in protective glass
domes along the length of the shaft, and small holes appear at regular
intervals along the walls, though given the decidedly stale air within, they
are not used for ventilation.

Outside of the sparse stores of Toulouse Street, the street lamps are
well-maintained and their light is of an illuminating white; however,
between, before, and after the collective body of public storefronts there
are very few that work correctly, and many that refuse to at all, leaving a
good third of the narrow slash through the city in darkness.  The sidewalks
are of an old, smooth, and occasionally cracked stone of a dark grey hue;
broken up in many places by iron grills or sewer lids which lazily let out
clouds of steam into the air like sleeping dragons beneath the paving slabs.
Unlit balconies peer down from above; watch points for the fearful or the
fearless whom care to observe the darkened street below.

#pSalon#n~
Small, yet comfortable, this room is not designed for entertaining more
than a couple of guests at a time, and given its location, it is not likely
more than a handful of beings have ever set foot inside.  The walls are
painted a warm sandy brown, and the thick beige carpet that lines the floor
keeps out any subterranean chill while recessed fixtures in the ceiling
provide soft, indirect illumination.  A brown leather sofa sits in the
middle of the room facing a large flat screen TV that most often displays
feeds from the security cameras placed throughout the property.  A few
fashion magazines are stacked on the glass topped coffee table in front of
the sofa and tasteful landscape portraits hung on the walls give the room a
slightly less sterile feel.  A well-stocked bar takes up most of the east
wall, offering top-shelf liquor laced with a variety of blood types, and a
small refrigerator beneath the bar holds an ample supply of unlaced blood in
IV bags.  Mounted beside the door that leads out to access shaft, is a
keypad and fingerprint sensor as well as a small screen that displays the
feeds from the cameras within the shaft.

#pWorkroom#n~
Part study and part ritual chamber, this workroom is nevertheless as
sterile and obsessively neat as every other room in the house and haven. 
However, the books that fill the shelves along the north wall are of a much
darker and more obscure nature than the ones upstairs, and the carved
granite altar that sits in the middle of the room conjures up images of
ritual sacrifice rather than mainstream scholarly pursuits.  The shelves
that line the west wall hold mortars and pestles, jars containing a wide
variety of herbs and other, more sinister ingredients as well as an
assortment of knives, ornately carved and fashioned from obsidian as well as
iron and silver.  A mahogany desk sits in front of the bookshelves at the
north end of the room, and like the one upstairs, it is always clear of
papers, with only a fairly new looking laptop gracing its surface on a
regular basis.  Lighting is provided by a myriad of pillar candles, though
they are of the LED variety given the lack of oxygen in the room, and the
faint scent of bleach and disinfectant hangs persistently in the air.

#eA Dark Resting Place#n~
This fairly small bedchamber is dimly lit by a single recessed fixture in
the middle of the ceiling, making it difficult to determine the exact shade
of the dark coloured walls and carpet.  An imposing king sized bed swathed
in onyx silk sheets and piled with at least half a dozen pillows takes up
the majority of the floor space, and a mahogany wardrobe stands against the
west wall.  There is little else in the way of furnishings in the room save
for what appears to be a carved granite sarcophagus that rests on the floor
along the east wall, half-hidden by shadows.

#pA pastel pink shotgun style home#n~
Through an iron arbor draped in fragrant magnolia the distressed white
paint of the front door comes into view, fitted with a modern addition to
the antique brass lock.  The door opens to reveal a narrow living space, the
faded brick of the walls worn smooth and nearly salmon in colour.  The dark
wooden beams of the ceiling are exposed.  Matching wood was used for the
glossy floorboards.  The furniture harkens back to Edwardian fashion, with
not a wooden surface built without a beautiful decorative inlay.  Nesting
end tables sit beside a crossbranded satinwood sofa with a fretwork panel on
the back.  A plump rose storage bench sits before it.  The massive flat
screen television is mounted above a short demilune chest with a coppery
patina, holding a noveau Tiffany accent lamp replete with graceful scrolls
streaked by cerise and moss green.  Touches of muted aubergine ripple
through the glass shade's bone beige grid.  Above the breakfast bar is a
large, framed painting of Scottish Blackface on the heather moorlands. 
Three mahogany stools line the bar, complete with thick cream cushions. 
Beauty is spread through the parlor in forms of furniture and subtle decor,
mounted upon the walls or placed gingerly into visually appealing locations.
A large brick fireplace occupies much of the wall opposite the door, with a
Bouquet of Lilies Faberg clock egg sitting at the center of the cream
painted mantle.  Framing the sofa in with the television is a burgundy
Mridienne, and a pale silk coverlet folded over the arm.  A dark mahogany
staircase hugs the wall.

#rA steep mahogany staircase#n~
The staircase was crafted of a dark, lustrous mahogany, aged with a
coppery patina.  A cream runner follows the steps, molded around their
shapes, making footfalls all but silent.  The walls give the impression of
once having been much further apart, then the inclusion of recessed shelving
narrowed the walkway.  The staircase is very long - much longer and more
steep than in modern homes.  Lining the entire length are books packed into
the walls on the shelves provided for them.  Sets of antique encyclopedias,
old record books from places long forgotten, untranslated collections of old
english poetry, and similarly esoteric yet factual literature are the
novelties most commonly found, though a collection of modern graphic novels
and a few trash paperbacks have been snuck in.  A drum-shade pendant light
hangs from the sloping ceiling; the frosted glass diffuser alleviates glare
beneath the paper shade.

#rA red brick hall with two doors#n~
The walls are solid red brick.  The bricks are slightly aged so that the
edges are soft and the mortar is webbed with fine cracks.  A painted canvas
of a dark-haired man with roguish appeal is mounted on the flat wall
opposite the stairwell, meeting the eyes upon reaching the hall.  The canvas
is framed with rich mahogany.  There is no curtain over the one window,
which is wide and overlooking the iron balconies and pastel buildings of St.
Peter Street.  At night the light comes from no discernable source, though
the hall is well lit.  There is a heavy, dark wood door on either side of
the walkway, facing each other across the hall.  The doors are fitted with
the original hand-crafted iron knobs and large, old-fashioned key holes. 
Beneath the painting on the far wall sits a set of Edwardian nesting tables.
On the largest of these is a clear vase containing an impressive arrangement
of fresh white Asphodel and neatly trimmed sprigs of Bilberry leaves.

#rAn opulent bedroom looking over St. Peter Street#n~
Cream carpet covers the floor of the bedroom, and the brick walls have
been treated with plaster; finishing them is antique wallpaper with the
color and consistency of thick parchment.  The dresser and armoire are grand
affairs, standing each tall as an average man and crafted from a rich, dark
wood with black lion's paws for feet.  The bedside table is a matching
style, substance and color, holding a bronze bust of a bearded man, three
books pressed between dark wood weights and a bouquet of Laurel-leaved
Magnolia in a rose glass vase.  The bed frame must weigh at least a ton.  It
matches the dresser and armoire; the same dark wood and lion's paw feet. 
The thick mattress is fitted with white Egyptian linens and layers of rich
cream coverlets.  Far too many pillows for any one person are piled at the
head.  The pillow cases are in varying shades of white, cream, and beige. 
There are windows on both sides of the corner where the bed is located,
covered with French rose curtains.  Dark wooden shutters are beneath the
curtains, sealed snugly shut through the nighttime hours.  A hope chest with
a plump cream cushion on the lid sits at the foot of the bed.  A narrow
opening in the wall is framed with cream crown molding, and through it can
be spied Victorian hat boxes, articles of feminine clothing on a
free-standing rack, and a beautiful mahogany dressing table with a Pulaski
mirror.  Organic cosmetics stand with an ivory brush and a clear bottle of
Joy by Jean Patou.  Hair pins are set upon a silver hand mirror.

`eUrsulines Street (Avg. NPCs: 0)`n~
This tiny street is just barely wide enough for a full sized vehicle to
pass down, leaving the majority of traffic up to feet - feet which, after
nightfall, are a distinct rarity.  Parked cars line the street on either
side, creating an even more cramped space for passage in the cracked black
asphault road itself.  Nestled between the lines of unmoving vehicles and
the elegant paved stoops of flat-faced buildings are sidewalks, laden over
with heavy, spanish-moss laced branches.  The branches criss cross thickly
overhead; patches of silvery light manage to filter through to the walkways
below.  Most of the windows are boarded up on the buildings a result of
robberies and hurricanes.  Mostly empty pots dangle from the balconies
overhead, the few still living plants offering the only discernable greenery
- besides the trees, of course, which appear black at nighttime - on
Ursulines.

#eA road that winds up a bayou hill#n~
The area stretches out endlessly, is the bayou cut by a ribbon of
pavement that turns straight up a substantial hillside.  A gravel road
emerges heading off to the northwest.  Snowy white lilies skim the murky
surface of the bayou, their sickeningly sweet floral scent hiding something
darker, more ominous.  The lilies seethe with movement as tiny frogs jump
from flower to flower, their dull green and brown speckled backs blight on
the bright whiteness.  The croaks of the frogs drown out the hum of the
locusts, and mighty splashes occur periodically as hordes of them hop into
the water, sending waves and ripples through the bayou.  A thick fog hangs
over the area, muffling all sounds and turning even familiar landmarks into
vague, alien shapes.  The pale, watery light manages to alleviate the gloom
only marginally.  A fluttering breeze can occasionally be felt, rustling a
few leaves then whispering away.

#pChateau de Augustin#n~
Built on a hillside overlooking the bayou and Pontartrain estuary, the
Louisiana estate of the Augustin Family was designed and built over a period
of twenty long years and more resembles a medieval hilltop castle than a
family manse.  The main chateau is on the highest part of the hill with two
Siam teak roof towers modeled after the ornamental balconied turrents in
Ronda, Spain, flanking a gabled projection composed of fine grade concrete
and quarried stone, washed out with salt and white sand from Carmel.  The
garden work is on steep hillsides, requiring endless steps, trestles and
terracing.  The buildings are tiled, fireproof, and braced for severe
storms.  Craftsmen, carpenters, plasterers, stone casters, tile-layers and
skilled wood-carvers added the stylistic ornaments on the estate's exterior,
which made settings for numerous artistic elements collected by the
Augustins in travels to Verona and Rome.  The eclectic whole is southern
Spanish Renaissance in style with integrated Gothic influence, beautiful to
behold with its historic architectural motifs and antiqued sophistication. 
Stone washed steps rise through the main terrace on the face of the castle

`eUrsulines Street (Avg. NPCs: 0)`n~
This tiny street is just barely wide enough for a full sized vehicle to
pass down, leaving the majority of traffic up to feet - feet which, after
nightfall, are a distinct rarity.  Parked cars line the street on either
side, creating an even more cramped space for passage in the cracked black
asphault road itself.  Nestled between the lines of unmoving vehicles and
the elegant paved stoops of flat-faced buildings are sidewalks, laden over
with heavy, spanish-moss laced branches.  The branches criss cross thickly
overhead; patches of silvery light manage to filter through to the walkways
below.  Most of the windows are boarded up on the buildings a result of
robberies and hurricanes.  Mostly empty pots dangle from the balconies
overhead, the few still living plants offering the only discernable greenery
- besides the trees, of course, which appear black at nighttime - on
Ursulines.

#pSouthern Terrace of Chateau de Augustin#n~
A stone arbour forms a shaded passageway around the main terrace. 
Vertical pillars support cross beams and a sturdy open lattice upon which
woody vines and magenta bougainvillea are trained.  The floor is speckled
with the petals of flowers and intermittent leaves, swept across neatly
fitted stones and mortar.  The main entrance to the villa is accessible at a
central point, where the arbour opens to the open sky and a pair of large
iron-banded doors are latched.  A smattering of tactful stone benches with
ornately embroidered red cushions are placed on the terrace.  At the
furthest eastern point is a lattice coop with a few cooing lovebirds perched
on living withies.  The enclosure is open to the air to the east, and has a
small door with a copper latch toward the terrace.

to allow access to a birdbath on a circular platform.  Avian fauna common to
the region flutter about the cool water and peck at the bits of seed
scattered around the basin.

#pChateau de Augustin, the Vestibule#n~
Acting as an ante-chamber between the exterior and interior structure,
the rectangular room between the doors and the lobby mimics the classical
architecture from which the vestibule originates.  Two rows of pale stone
columns support the low roof, which boasts a Florentine Renaissance fresco
depicting the fall of a red-haired Eve in the lush Garden of Eden.  Serpent
motifs are found throughout.  To the south the large iron-banded doors open
onto the southern terrace, while the north bears an open arch framed with
dark wood that allows access into the assembly room.  A stout rack made from
a wood so dark it appears black sits beside the doors, home to a few pairs
of footwear.  Select pieces of classic art line the vestibule, framed in
gold leaf and protected by glass.  The floor is a cool, light marble with a
sparing pattern crafted by inserts of gold tile.  A peek of the grand
chandelier in the assembley room is visible from the vestibule; the lowest
tier of crystal drops and a wash of clean light.

#pChateau de Augustin, Assembly Room#n~
Tall arch-topped windows with lush mauve draperies and panels of art
between use exaggerated motion and clear, easily interpreted detail to
produce exuberance and grandeur, circling occupants of the castle's assembly
room on every side.  The dramatic style of the paintings and recessed mural
work between the windows was used as a means of impressing triumphant power
and control through expression of wealth; excessive detail, dramatically
styled, and contrasting the palette of the cream marble floors and domed
ceiling with rich colors.  A crystal chandelier with a hundred sparkling
tiers hangs over the center of the assembly, where ornate card tables, a
massive ballroom area for proper parties and dances, and a beautiful wine
cabinet with a matching bar.  A host of a thousand dark wood chairs with
strong heraldic embellishments are arranged in a V, facing the wide open
area where guests would gather during social gatherings.  A large arch opens
into the vestibule to the south, and to the north lies the refectory.  A
pair of hinged wooden shaft-access doors are on the western wall, recessed
into a shadowed alcove.

`eToulouse Street (Avg. NPCs: 15)`n~
Outside of the sparse stores of Toulouse Street, the street lamps are
well-maintained and their light is of an illuminating white; however,
between, before, and after the collective body of public storefronts there
are very few that work correctly, and many that refuse to at all, leaving a
good third of the narrow slash through the city in darkness.  The sidewalks
are of an old, smooth, and occasionally cracked stone of a dark grey hue;
broken up in many places by iron grills or sewer lids which lazily let out
clouds of steam into the air like sleeping dragons beneath the paving slabs.
Unlit balconies peer down from above; watch points for the fearful or the
fearless whom care to observe the darkened street below.

A pair of hinged wooden shaft-access doors seal the opulent elevator
chamber.  There are only two buttons on the antiqued panel, the bottom
leading to the ground floor, the top to the second floor.  The upper towers
are accessible by staircases only, with no easy access provided.  Plush red
velvet covers the walls in quilted panels, making each section look slightly
pillowed.  The fixtures are gold and the ceiling an antique mirror, framed
with ornate gold leaf and smoothly molded.  A long mahogany bench neatly
piled with gold-embroidered red pillows is against the wall opposite the
elevator doors.

`rSt. Charles Street Going to Prytania (Avg. NPCs: 12)`n~
The coarse, weathered urban mass that is Canal Street slowly slips into
distant memory, giving a whole new meaning to the phrase 'Out of sight, out
of mind.  ' The towering grey stone buildings and seedy atmosphere is
gradually replaced by the aesthetic comfort of ordered willow tree rows,
square, clean lawns and reality-shifting large domiciles.  A
well-maintained, Victorian-esque street car moves along the center of the
road upon its own immaculate tack way, a light bell jangling at regular,
structured intervals to announce itself.  The upscale, lawful feel continues
onward to the Intersection of Poydras and Prytania.

#pChateau de Augustin, Refectory#n~
The refectory ceiling arches high to a central peak that is supported by
an ornate black pillar with pale marbled fittings, positioned at the very
center of the room.  A lavobo - or large basin for hand-washing - is
provided in an alcove to the west of the main refectory.  The water is crisp
and cool, bubbling up from a tap in the bottom of the basin.  Red rose
petals float on the surface, and clean white towels are provided beside the
pool.  Like its Benedictine architectural ancestor the refectory is laid out
on an east-west axis, so the sun pours in through the high and elaborate
Clerestory windows both at sunrise and sundown.  Long antique benches run
along the sides of two massive banquet tables.  The benches are crafted of
stone, fixed with gold-embroidered crimson cushions.  Candelabras with
electric bulbs are placed every few feet down the length of each table,
casting light over the hundreds of sterling silver place settings.  To the
south an open arch framed with dark wood opens into the assembley room.

`rIntersection of Poydras and Prytania (Avg. NPCs: 9)`n~
This portion of the garden district is not an Intersection as one might
really imagine an intersection to be; it is, very simply, a road diverting
away from Prytania and St.  Charles, an unremarkable road that leads off to
what appears to be a commercially built stretch off a ways toward the
Mississippi.  Prytania Street itself is unblemished by this junction;
Prytania is unblemished quite entirely.  The street is the beginnings of
where the money lies in the Big Easy; the street lamps are crafted from
wrought-iron to look like bastions of order and normalcy, the roads are
straight and immaculately clean and the houses are dauntingly similar to
castles of old Lords.  Police patrols are common enough to keep the area
lawful to the highest degree, though it is far from safe in many regards
that are not obvious to most.  A bright white painted picket fence surrounds
one of the many stately complexes to the north -- separated from the
'intersection' by an ample, rolling lawn.  Upon the gate reads a sigh in
eye-catching green paint: #gFoundation House of New Orleans#n.

#pChateau de Augustin, the Morning Room#n~
In eighteenth-century France the royal morning receptions took place in
the room outside the king's bedroom, where the privileged members of the
court would gather to see him make his first formal public appearance of the
day.  Though no kings are on the premises and the castle bedrooms are all
secluded to the second floor, the morning room harkens back to that
time-honored tradition, providing a concealed place for honored guests to
withdraw with the man or woman of the house without entering private living
areas.  The wide bay windows provide east-facing exposure, making the lounge
suitable for daytime calls.  The walls are cream colored with an
encompassing gold Fleur-de-lis pattern.  Three tiers of crown moulding are
made of real ivory, carved ornately to best exploit light and shadow with
dramatic intensity; it is purely Baroque in style, matching the tone of the
furnishings.  Beautiful arch-topped mirrors with gleaming, ornate gold
frames are mounted upon the walls, mingled with pieces of Mannerist art. 
The fireplace is made of the same ivory as the moulding, with gold leaf
hammered in intricate patterns through the detail work.  A crystal
chandelier with seven sparkling tiers drips from the ceiling, lighting the
morning room when sunlight is not feasible.  The hardwood floor is covered
with a cream colored area rug, framing the arrangement of plush white
furniture.  Near the entrance is a mirrored table with a massive bouquet of
fresh flowers in a Tiffany vase.  Candelabras and wood cabinets are found
throughout.  The billiard room is to the west through an open arch, and the
household pantries are to the east.

`rPrytania Street (Avg. NPCs: 7)`n~
Power lies within the Garden District, upon Prytania Street and the
surrounding roads linked to it; the power of wealth, the power to control. 
This power is in no way hidden, in fact, it is the opposite, existing within
everything around; from the illumination in district from the spherical orbs
atop the wrought-iron street lamps guarding the roads like troops, to the
fences that block out all of those who are unwelcome in the form of sharp,
tall iron barriers and gates fronting the domain-like manses of the
plantation acres.  People do not usually walk the streets here after dark,
the law is strict and the bribes make it stricter; thugs dont dare tread
these streets, whores dont exist in anything other than expensive dresses
and cars; thieves are punished, violence is rebuked and speeding is stopped
in its tracks.  Power and wealth, judging by the Garden District, are much
more fearsome than guns, knives and drugs.  An upper class restaurant pours
out light onto the sidewalk before it, its sign reading; `pThe Commander's
Palace Restaurant`n.

#pChateau de Augustin, The Billiard Room#n~
Smooth gray and taupe riverbed stones reminisce of castle walls.  Cut
into the stone are ivory-edged arches and dark wood doors, a vast hearth
with a mantle reaching nearly to the ceiling, pillared and shaped by
carving.  One of the Devonshire Hunting Tapestries, a 15th-century work
depicting a boar and bear hunt, coats the majority of the wall with the
eastern door; the foreground is filled with tiny trees, bushes and flowers,
rocky caves for bears and turbulent streams flush with water-fowl.  The
huntsmen and their prey crowd across the tapestry in two great tiers subtly
linked by intermediate figures, which lead the eye from group to group.  A
low, long table presses on either side of a multitude of squishy gold
wingbacked armchairs run the rest of the length.  Busts and bronze
statuettes of contemplative philosophers stand with an antique wood
Stromberg Carlson radio.  Two pool tables with light teal velvet, dark wood
and lion's paw feet run down the center of the billiard room.  The balls are
aged and antiqued, and pool cues and little cubes of white chalk provided on
racks.  A pair of gold chandeliers with four tiers of round yellow bulbs. 
The floor is made from sandstone blocks that nicely retain the heat of the
hearth.

`rPrytania Street within the Garden District (Avg. NPCs: 7)`n~
Houses designed in memory of old plantation mansions decorate the whole
of the street while large oak trees stretch out over the whole area casting
shade for all.  Each house is situated almost directly next to the next,
offering only the smallest of yards.  Smooth sidewalks line the road under
the shade of massive oak trees for walkers, joggers and bike riders.  This
is surely the epitome of upscale society in the whole of New Orleans.  The
light rumble of the street car sounds off every few minutes as it passes
down the center of the street, going from Tulane University all the way to
the French Quarter.  Houses designed in memory of old plantation mansions

#pChateau de Augustin, the Pantry#n~
As a combination larder and buttery, the entire pantry is kept at a brisk
thirty-seven degrees.  Filling an entire L-shaped wing on the east side of
the villa, food, provisions, dishes, linens, dried goods, china, alcoholic
stores, meats, and spices are kept in hearty stock on the hundreds of
shelves.  The first branch of the wing holds barrels of flour, sugars, salt,
and oils, ranging from olive to corn.  The majority of shelf-space is packed
with neatly organized spices imported from Columbia, the Orient, South
America, and similar regions where the best of the best can be acquired. 
Coffee beans fill the hundreds of bags in one area, but there are twice as
many cannisters of rich English teas, both pre-bagged and in dry leaf form. 
The air-locked door to the west has been covered with a facade of rich
mahogany wood.  To the northeast the pantry wing continues, stretching an
entire quarter mile.

The plantation homes here are among the largest and most imposing of the
district as a whole; lawns stretching for acres, fields of numerous crops,
gardens of roses and ferns and towering cypress trees each carving out
enormous chunks of the Louisiana landscape with great scoops of ardent,
structured color and order.  The manses themselves are each large in their
own individual rights; some being tall, others sprawled and single story;
for the most part, however, they are three-tiered and classically
formidable, flanked with fences, acres, guards and a certain pulse of
omnipotence.  The immaculate, yellow-lit streets are riddled with police
patrols, but aside from that they are usually empty.

the villa, food, provisions, dishes, linens, dried goods, china, alcoholic
stores, meats, and spices are kept in hearty stock on the hundreds of

larder, where hundreds of whole chickens, sides of beef, salted bacon, pork,
and similar flesh perishables.  A hearty supply of shrimp, lobsters in their
own heated tank and containment unit, oysters, and other seafood delicacies
are also stored.  There are old-fashioned glass bottles of milk filling a
shelf with glass doors, dated meticulously by the household staff.  Set away
from the meats and seafood is a large sector dedicated to the storage of
perishable pastry and cake supplies, ranging from bulk chocolate chips to
professional grade buttercream.  To the west the pantry door is visible past
the dry goods storage.

the chateau, food, provisions, dishes, linens, dried goods, china, alcoholic
stores, meats, and spices are kept in hearty stock on the hundreds of
shelves.  The furthest northeast point of the wing is home to shelves
covered with neatly folded bed linens, clean towels, soaps, cleansers, and
other household amenities.  Before that area is reached, however, one must
walk through the buttery, a place with nothing but the butt-end of wine
bottles peek out of the lattice-work shelving on both sides of the walkway. 
Wines of the finest vintage, imported Champagne, Scotch, and other forms of
alcohol are dusted daily and kept in pristine condition for eventual use. 
There is a six by six portion of lattice-work that has been painted red, and
the bottles in those holes appear newer than those around them.  To the
south the walkway leads into the pantry larder.

gardens of roses and ferns and towering cypress trees each carving out
enormous chunks of the Louisiana landscape with great scoops of ardent,
structured color and order.  The manses themselves are each large in their
own individual rights; some being tall, others sprawled and single story;
for the most part, however, they are three-tiered and classically
formidable, flanked with fences, acres, guards and a certain pulse of
omnipotence.  The immaculate, yellow-lit streets are riddled with police
patrols, but aside from that they are usually empty.

#cThe Artemis Pool at Chateau de Augustin#n~
The engineering of the Artemis Pool is as much a triumph as its aesthetic
impact.  On a site excavated from the steep hillside, the pool is hung by
reinforced-concrete beams from the retaining wall in such a way that seismic
movement would let it sway but not break.  Water flows in from natural
springs above, piped into two reserve tanks of tremendous capacity.  Below
the pool is a large room housing a complex filter system based on the
purifying power of sand and an electric heating unit used to keep the water
at a brisk seventy degrees.  Tiled terraces around the pool house seventeen
opulent dressing rooms with baths and recessed mirrors in the marble
foundations.  Gardens surround the pool on all sides, too thick with tidy
greenery and lush blooms for walkways.  Two semi-circular colonnades of
marble surround the hundred foot long pool, and at the center is a
Greco-roman temple facade imported from authentic Roman ruins overseas.  The
floor of the pool displays a navy blue geometric design, mostly squares with
ornate edgings.  The rest is white tile.  All around the pool a flat surface
of white and gray tile support Greco-roman sculpture and sun-bathing chairs
made of light teak.

#pChateau de Augustin, Second Story Landing#n~
The elevator opens to a lush landing with glossy wood floors.  The walls
are painted a dark, sultry crimson with black crown moulding edging the
vaulted ceiling.  Overhead a stained glass dome rises into the sky, a glory
of light in brilliant colour by day and a murky canvas by night.  The edge
of the landing is supported by a frame of tall black marble pillars streaked
by arteries of pale gold.  The landing looks out over the vestibule. 
Elegant busts of matronly women and subdued men sit atop the pillars.  Fresh
flowers, wet, dark orchids and sultry red roses, are packed into Tiffany
vase, positioned on a long table that runs along the wall opposite the
pillared balcony.  Above hangs a portrait in a gold filigree frame.

Glossy wood floors echo under foot.  The walls are painted a dark, sultry

much by way of decor as the hall trails on, crossing a quarter mile into the
middle depth.  To the north a pair of thick red doors open into the Della

for guests at the estate.  The ceiling to the west begins to vault upward,

#rDella Robbia Guest Room#n~
Rough sandstone blocks that retain the heat from the great carved hearth
are covered by an exquisite Persian rug, soft and warm underfoot.  The walls
are pale cream abdobe and draped with rich tapestries, the majority of which
depict religious themes; the Temptation of Eve hangs behind the bed, a
unique piece dating back to the Florentine Renaissance, woven from a dark,
melodious blend of colours.  A stout, ornately carved mahogany dressing
table is fitted with a rust toned marble top and stacked with antique books
between a pair of masculine statuettes of Adonis' torso.  The bed is a
lesson in extravagance, supporting centuries-old goose down mattresses on a
polished, reddish wood frame fit for royalty.  Four majestic posts on each
corner of the bed span to the ceiling before ending in deeply carved
bollards.  The headboard is fashioned with carved pillars and the shape of a
crown topping them, and the footboard minimal in comparison.  Sheets and
blankets of warm cream, created from the softest materials known to mankind
with a cloth-of-gold coverlet and many plump down pillows are fitted to the
bed.  A broad carved arch leads through a pair of red painted doors back
into the hall, and a similar set lead to the bathroom and spa.

An older, but well maintained, preserved building shows pride and care in

of pamphlets, sheets and flyers, announcing everything from college
scholarships, government loans, counseling advice, to raves, fraternity
houses, dances and other social events.  Some padded chairs line the walls
and offices off to both sides are marked student counseling.  A sign at the
reception desk announces the hours each week someone is available for
appointments.

#eLafayette Cemetery No. 1#n~
High stone gates topped by iron spires encircle the Lafeyette Cemetary,
containing all the history of heavy nineteenth century burials in elaborate
mausoleums, tombs and jagged rows of massive, crumbling stones.  The grass
and shrubbery show signs of neglect, in places growing so wild they have all
but overtaken whole portions of the various winding paths.  Almost all of
the mausoleums have been ransacked or explored by now, evident in the broken
and discarded chains that once protected them, the disturbances in the dust
of their smooth, cold floors and the drawers left ajar where graverobbers
undoubtedly took anything of worth from the chilled and grasp of it's former
owner.  Unlike the majority of other cemetaries in New Orleans, at least
those with historical significance, the reek of death is heavy here; an
all-consuming, invisible cloud that warns at some hidden unpleasantness,
something unearthed and virile.

mausoleums, becoming shorter and less elaborate as they sink into a brisk
thicket of massive cypress.  At the very edge of the cemetary proper, where
the path and markers taper off into marshy earth, shaded in thick darkness
by arching branches overhead, lies a small mound of freshly turned earth,
atop which lies a pair of perfect white `wLilies`n intertwined about the

surrounds it.  Preventing the ring from sinking further into the mud is a
thick, once cream-coloured business card reading 'Bryant and Garnier.  '

`bNorth Rampart Street (Avg. NPCs: 2)`n~
Far removed from it's southern brothers, North Rampart Street bears no
real nightlife, no party-goers, and no tourists; what people there are
travel in clusters, huddling close to one another around barrels filled with
burning debris, or moving quick by the mouths of narrow alleyways reeking of
vomit, urine and worse.  The majority of streetlamps - being all of mundane,
modern design; none of the elegant Victorian replicas have carried over to
this portion of the city - are burned out or yellowed, buzzing sources of
light, often flickering on and off to leave anyone below in complete
darkness.  The occasional car creeps by, and from time to time a lone
individual can be seen settling down against the wall of an old shot-gun
styled building.  All along the median toward the `PLSU Hospital`n are old
sculptures.  The height of the various buildings, along with trees lining
the median, causes the whole area to be quite dimmed compared to the
brightness of Canal Street to the east.

#pThe Library at Chateau de Augustin#n~
The high arch of the ceiling and slope of the walls gives the library
hall a tear-drop shape.  Dark wood beams follows the curve of the roof to
the gothique revival iron lamps that hang down over a long, black wood
table.  Faded antiqued fresco runs the curves of the walls to the peak of
the ceiling, filling the spaces between beams with panels of richly toned
religious scenes.  Edwardian wingback chairs number eight, four on each long
side of the table.  The glossy copper parquet floor is swept clean of any
trace of dust.  All along the walls on ground level, dark wood cabinets with
ornate iron fretwork doors seal away centuries' worth of books, maps, and
other literary curiosities.  To the south a jagged gothic arch framed with
iron opens into a warm chamber, the green foliage and blooms of flowers in
the conservatory visible from the library.  A locked door to the east leads
to Byron's study, and a beautiful grandfather clock with a scrollwork face
sits beside it, the iron hands and pendulum unmoving.

#rDella Robbia Spa and Bathroom#n~
Though a stone edged, round-topped arch in the Della Robbia lies a deep
pool in the center of the opulent bathroom.  The flooring is cream-coloured
sandstone that hugs the edges of the warm pool, and the pool itself is tiled
with goldleaf tile, a mosiac of waves in dark blues and black at the deepest
center of the bath.  Thick blue curtains can be pulled around the pool by
pulling a golden rope.  The shower borders the northern wall, spilling a
generous waterfall from the gleaming showerhead.  A window fills an entire
wall of the shower, where little glass bottles of shampoo, conditioner,
essential oils and a black marble dish for a fresh bar of lavender soap are
neatly arranged on the sandstone ledge.  Thick, clean black towels are
folded into a wall of dark wood shelves.  Over the top of a vanity with
three deeply set sandstone sinks is a long, flat mirror that covers the
majority of the wall.  Black silk robes hang from the wall beside the arch
that leads back into the Della Robbia.  The only sealed off portion of the
bathroom is the bidet, which has its own door and a securing lock on the
inside of the dark wood chamber.

#CS#Ppin#C (#PAvg. NPCs: 203#C)#n~
Life in general has room for a little more indulgence - especially when
the glucose in question is Spin, the nightspot with a sweet and sugary
theme.  Located on Perdido Street in the Metairie, the wide open,
warehouse-style club pays homage to all things sweet.  From the joint's
sugar cube-inspired candleholders to the three custom-made rock candy walls,
guests are glad the owners went with Sugar instead of the original name and
concept, Butter.  Other candy-like extravagence includes three bars, an
elevated, roped-off VIP level, a sound system that focuses volume on the
dance floor (and off your conversation), and, in the back, a red brick
smoking room filled with bowls of Gobstoppers.  Further adding to the
dilemmas of both diabetics and married men are high-heeled waitresses in
pink camisoles and black miniskirts serving cocktails like the Grape Laffy
Taffy and the Lemon Drop.  Sugar is home to a state of the art Kyrogenifex,
which blankets the entire space in a dense and chilly fog that lowers the
temperature a fell ten degrees in seconds, because when clubbers are
indulging to excess, the last thing they want is overheating.

#wA side street off North Rampart#n~
Only a few cars trickle down this side street, flocking to either the
Louis Armstrong Park or the St.  Louis No.  1 Cemetery.  The park is tucked
neatly behind a high retaining wall made of red brick, and the cemetery is
framed by an iron corn-husk fence that stands six or seven feet high. 
Luscious trees and tropical flowers spill over the park wall, dominating the
western view, while tall mausoleoms and extravagent graves to the west throw
a majestic shadow over the street.  A shared parking lot is straight ahead. 
Antique streetlamps with dark iron posts warm the humid air with yellow
halos.

#cBroussard's#n #e(Avg. NPCs: 12)#n~
A flurry of round pine tables are placed in wide semi-circle layers
around the airy brasserie, ten tables per tier, a single step separating
each level from the next; traditional white linens, crisp, clean and
spartan, are fitted over each table.  The menus are printed on fine scroll
paper and placed on display at the center of every table, while utensils
wrapped artfully in knotted cloth napkins sit beside them.  The same menu is
served from opening until closing, from eight in the evening until two in
the morning, and the dishes are elaborately prepared and presented in small,
numerous courses produced by the large and hierarchal staffs behind the
kitchen walls.  From the famous caille en sar in a puffed pastry shell
special to the foie grass, mirepoix, and truffle sauces, the key to
Broussard's high-end popularity is flawless haute cuisine.  The walls are
almost entirely composed of windows, with the antique red brick of the old
building framing the panes.  Because of the large windows and the effect of
the exterior on visitors' visual experience, the environment outside is
strictly controlled; lush Parisian gardens draped with fragrant
Mediterranean blooms and curious marble statuary surround the building, at
least where the windows can see.  The ceiling is low and dimly lit.

The lot is always at least a little packed with the vehicles of tourists
and residents who have come to visit the cemetery or park.  Bronze meters at
each parking spot accept nickels, dimes, and quarters, though most of them
are out of service; the coin slots are covered with tape.  Luscious trees
and tropical flowers spill over the park wall, dominating the western view,
while tall mausoleoms and extravagent graves to the west throw a majestic
shadow over the street.  Entering the Louis Armstrong Park is a simple
matter; park and walk through the cement bollards to the east.  The cemetery
is a different concern; the gates close at sundown and one must slip through
or climb over the fence.  Antique streetlamps with dark iron posts warm the
humid air with yellow halos.

#oW#polfslair #oB#piergarten #o(#pAvg#o.#p NPCs#o:#p 27#o)#n~
More of a luxury destination than a place just to lounge, Wolfslair has
elevated the New Orleans biergarten game with its Edwardian revival
chandeliers, lots of blackletter, and - of all things - a stuffed wolf
snarling over the dining room from behind the bar.  The extensive selection
of dark beers range from Belgian brew Chimay to more local concoctions like
Solidarity.  The cuisine is German inspired with a mix of Haitian comfort
food.  The atmosphere is dark and muted with a haze of fragrant tobacco
smoke.  Black wood covers the sloping gables in the ceilings.  Separated by
shoulder-height wood dividers, each table has a stressed wooden surface
surrounded by black leather stools.  The lights are dim and opaque,
globe-shaped and hung upon thick iron stems around the dining room.  Heavy
glass pint glasses hang over the bar from an ornate iron rack, and the
seating behind are thick dark wood stools with leather padded cushions.

#eSt. Louis No.1 Cemetery#n~
The wrought-iron gates are well-oiled and maintained to a degree of
imposition against the world before them; guarding the innards of the St. 
Louis No.  1 cemetery within.  Stepping through them is like stepping across
the distance of a mile shrunk into one step; the outside world seems to be
muffled and distanced by the sheet atmosphere of the graveyard.  The path is
cobbled and indirect, snaking its way toward the cemetery proper like a
serpent across the lawn, patches of those cobbles being missing and replaced
by a smooth clever of concrete which likely looks neat during daylight, but
after they represent decay and macabre vision.  The cemetery is old, and the
air seems to carry the memories of those whom yet still inhabit both the
dilapidated, crumbled mausoleums and tilted headstones and those whom are
still fresh within the marble confines of the newly-erected tombs.  Graffiti
is lazily grazed upon certain areas, satanic symbols, names, images ranging
from a large violet eye to an alien smoking a joint.  Broken gargoyles are
the watchmen when the caretaker is sleeping.

#gEcco #cUltra#e Lounge#n (Avg. NPCs: 42)~
The Metairie's new green-minded lounge Ecco soft-opened less than a year
ago, and would like customers to believe they are saving the world by
hitting their dance floor.  So far, they've done a pretty good job.  Just
pull up to the valet, where there's no charge for clubbers driving hybrids,
and once inside everything anyone drinks, eats, sees, or dances upon is
probably recycled, salvaged, free-range, energy-efficient, paperless or
waterless - though most care less about the organic wallpaper than the
organic gin.  Guests who show up early can order dolphin-safe Tonnino
Yellowfin Tuna Croquettes and Tempura Tofu with Udon Noodles.  Later, when
the music turns up, folks stay for a few drinks like the house special Alter
Eco - heavy on that organic gin - or the Absinthe-Minded, which tends to
make the trip to the dance floor a bit more hallucinatory.  They swear it's
organic absinthe, so surely that makes consumption more noble.

#rSin#e (Avg. NPCs: 84)#n~
It's the old nightlife conundrum - some people don't feel like dealing
with some Drakkar-scented club where rehabbed starlets' bodyguards occupy
all the good seats, but they're wearing too nice of a shirt to waste on some
McPub.  New Orleans' newest happy medium is Vice, soft-opened six months
ago.  Since taking over the space of the footwear-themed Star Shoes, Vice
has transformed the narrow room on the city strip into a dark lair for
lounging, with black leather booths, a stainless-steel and snakeskin bar,
zebra wood floors and candle-dotted walls.  Velvet-rope touches are kept to
a minimum with no flashlight-giddy bouncers, no tooth-sucking attitude and
the most reasonably priced bottle service found outside liquor stores. 
There is a guest list, but if someone isn't on it, looks decent, and the
place isn't crowded, they're in.  The VIP balcony over the dance floor comes
with an open-air skylight to allow for smoking.

#rFoxtail #e<Avg. NPCs: 65>#n~
Some time not long ago, the term "dinner and a movie" evolved.  The
latest place to greenlight a blockbuster over a meal is Foxtail, the
Metairie's cozy new A-list supper club.  Gone is the previous incarnation,
Lobby - after a dramatic overhaul, the once-cavernous space now comprises
two distinct and separate levels.  Entering the ground floor via the
shimmering rainbow-hued corridor, patrons find themselves in the restaurant
and lounge - victim of an apparent Art Deco, Art Nouveau, 70's glam
explosion.  The back wall is filled by a mirror with seats beneath it, and
seats sit before the stained glass windows on the front of the building. 
Bistro selections like burrata panzanella, Colorado lamb, and lavender pot
de creme can be washed down with the Corpse Reviver ##2 - a house special
made with Plymouth gin, Cointreau, Lillet Blanc, lemon juice and a mist of
absinthe.  Upstairs under a red-lit ceiling is the club, which boasts a
turquiose and copper smoking lounge and a separate side street entrance.

#cGrounds of an Aging Louisiana Colonial#n~
An aging picket fence coated with fresh white paint runs along the edge
of the dirt road that cuts a dry ribbon through the wetlands.  The expansive
grounds of a Louisiana colonial stands behind, framed on all sides by oak,
cypress and willows that form thick walls to stave off the wild growth of
the bayou.  The trees are draped with pale green spanish moss like sheets of
lace, with boughs all swarming with fireflies after dusk.  A terrace wraps
around the ground and second floors, the latter supported by plain wood
pillars.  The house is painted white with goldenrod yellow trim and the
colors have started to fade.  The front door is bright red and covered with
a swinging old-fashioned screen.  Ropes of fragrant star jasmine vine weave
thick through the terraces' lattice-work and thick purple stalks of lavender
squeeze up from under the porch.  From the roadside the opening in the white
picket fence leads up a foot path to the front porch.  The slanted gables of
the old colonial cut an elegant silhouette on the grounds below.

#gLouis Armstrong Public Park#n~
Smooth arches of deep gray and earthy reddish cobble stones form a large
version of an almost fish scale pattern for visitors to stroll over in the
open inviting space.  Stretching giants oaks and bald cypress offer a
verdant green back drop against the sky over head, lending the occasional
blocking of shade and shadow against the cobbled ground.  Long low green
benches bank the edges of the stone gathering area, blending into the
vegetation placed about them in aesthetically pleasing arrangements.  A
weathered brass `wplaque`n atop a slender pole offers the rich history for
those interested, placed in a position of prominence to easily draw
attention.  Silhouetted just beyond the tree line the outline of the
Municipal Auditorium can be seen joined by the Mahalia Jackson Center for
the Performing Arts, just beyond the lagoon.  A concrete walkway, lined with
tall glass shaded Victorian lamp posts, provides shade covered paths to
stroll as people meander past, heading off toward the bridge bedecked
lagoons and historic attractions.  A tall arched gate of weathered metal
spans the main entrance, just visible from the center of the square, large
white letters declaring the name of the park.

Congo square is in the vicinity of a spot which the local tribes used before 
the arrival of the French for celebrating their annual corn harvest, and was 
considered sacred ground. The gathering of the enslaved African venders in the 
Congo Square originated as early as the late 1740s during Louisianas French 
colonial era as one of the cities public markets. By 1805, Congo Square had 
become famous for the gatherings on Sunday afternoons. By 1812 these gatherings 
numbered as many as 500 to 600 people. The dances and music started here 
eventually evolved into New Orleans Jazz rhythm and blues.

#cAn Aging Colonial Home#n~
The hard wood floors are old and worn smooth as silk from generations of
feet.  The tall rectangular windows are plentiful and shine with light
during the hours of day; at night a glitter of fireflies float against the
backdrop of black skies and white stars.  Lace panels are mounted over the
glass panes and cheery yellow curtains line the window frames.  The original
19th century walls still stand around the sitting room, exposed red brick
riddled with nicks.  In the corner opposite the front door a spotless, large
brick hearth.  Wood is piled neatly in cupboard nearby, and an iron poker,
shovel, and bread toaster are provided beside the hearth.  The brick mantle
above the fire holds an old King James Bible on a wood stand and several
framed pictures of family and friends.  A faded antique rug forms a basis
around which furniture has been placed in the sitting area; the longer side
holds a clean Edwardian setee with a cozy afghan blanket folded across the
back and carved ball and claw legs.  A raised leg coffee table with a fine
coppery patina holds a couple newspapers and a bit of unfinished knitting. 
A pair of walnut framed fireside armchairs are on one of the short sides of
the rug, facing the sitting area and couch.  None of the lights are hard
wired into the old walls, so lamps are scattered throughout the lower story.
There is a land line phone installed on the wall between the sitting room
and the kitchen.  A opening in the north wall leads to the base of a wide,
very steep wood staircase.  To the east by passing through the kitchen there
is a screen door that opens into the grounds.

#gLouis Armstrong Public Park#n~
Built upon the bones of the Treme neighborhood where Jazz was born this
area of the sprawling allege choked lagoon and cracked pathways offers up a
more respectful nod toward the history that once enriched the area.  Several
antiquated buildings, each showing marked signs of neglect and abuse from
the elements, stands amongst lush banks of green grass blending almost
seamlessly into the murky waters.  Grand oaks sprawl heavy shade over the
linger remains of once grand structures such as the `wRabassa`n and`w
Reimann`n houses, each lined with tall glass shaded Victorian lamp posts. 
The same lanes of concrete cut their way through in a winding, snake like
fashion meandering into the aging bridges wrought of concrete and metal.  In
the distance the antiquated building that once served duty as a firehouse,
its usefulness long since passed, sits silhouetted against the city skyline.
Backed by bald cypress and solid stately oaks, the park holds a quiet
elegance that seems to pervade the city as a whole, made all the more
evident by the outline of a large building lingering on just past the homes,
recognizable as the Mahalia Jackson Center for the Performing Arts.  The
soulful sounds of blues and jazz drift along on the air, piped in by WWOZ
for the pleasure of those who stroll the walkways serving as a reminder to
the parks rich past.

reimann~
This yellow clad structure built in the late 1880s was moved from the 
historic remains of the Treme neighbor hood to be uses as the administrative 
building for the park, one of the few buildings to receive somewhat regular 
upkeep, its elaborate white railings starting to sag with age and weather.

The red structure serves as one of the few remaining early examples of a raised 
cottage structure. Crafted between 1825 and 1833 by Jean Louis Rabassa, little 
has changed from the broad white porch to the parks main fruit baring citrus 
grove that stands just behind it. The house shows the marks of age and neglect, 
as if little care has been given to it over the recent years.

Past the secluded elegance of the lagoon and the aged presence of the 
historic buildings the Cultural center comprised of the Mahalia Jackson 
Center for the Performing Arts and Municipal Auditorium stand in stark 
contrast with their solid classic lines and dry moss covered fountain. 
Singular groupings of cypress and oaks ringed in well tended flower gardens 
grace the tended walkways, this part of the park showing a constant and on 
going care. Tall Victorian street lamps offer a guiding light, each of the 
glass globes offering a gentle glow to those wishing to visit the home of 
the New Orleans Ballet or Opera. Slightly rises above the rest of the park 
in a dais like manner it offers a grand sweeping view of the grounds of the 
bastion as a whole, blending into the skyline of the city beyond. The 
faintest echoes of the soulful sounds of blues and jazz still drifting 
along on the air, piped in by WWOZ for the pleasure of those who stroll the 
walkways serving as a reminder to the parks rich past and uncertain future.

sprawling lagoon reaches out over the park, lush banks of green grass
blending almost seamlessly into the algae choked waters rimmed with
stunted bushy palm trees.  A concrete walkway, lined with tall glass shaded
Victorian lamp posts, cuts its way through in a winding, snake like fashion
the occasional weed poking up through a crack dotting the lane.  `wBridges`n
wrought of concrete and metal sweep up in graceful sturdy arcs offering
passage from one bank to the next.  The largest of them stands bedecked in
hundreds of lights as it spans the distance to the antiquated building that
once served duty as a firehouse, its usefulness long since passed as it sits
silhouetted in the distance closed off to public viewing.  Backed by bald
cypress and solid stately oaks, the park holds a quiet elegance that seems
to pervade the city as a whole, made all the more evident by the outline of
several more building further in.  The soulful sounds of blues and jazz

#cAn Aging Colonial Home, Marie's Bedroom#n~
Three sparkling crystal prisms hang from the window frame on fishing
line, positioned so they are hidden behind the lightly flower-patterned
white curtains when they've been drawn.  By day a flurry of rainbows are
thrown around the bedroom in the pouring sunlight.  The walls are painted a
very soft, pale pink.  The bed is simple and clean - a modest twin with a
wooden head and footboard, fitted with pure white cotton linens and
hand-quilted blankets in pastels of many colors.  The house is too old for
in-built closets, so an armoire of sturdy oak, aged with a fine coppery
patina, holds clothes and oddiments instead.  The dressing table and vanity
has a large mirror in the center and two smaller ones on both sides that
fold in toward the middle.  It is all framed in and painted white. 
Photographs, movie ticket stubs, business cards and dried flowers are slid
into the edges tucked between the frame and the mirror.  Cotton balls, a
moisturizing lotion that smells of grapefruit and mint, a small bottle of
perfume in an antique glass bottle, even a few items of modern make-up fill
the surface of the vanity table.  A sheer panel of Venetian lace is fitted
over the French doors to the west, opening onto a half-circular terrace that
grows over with thick ropes of kudzu and star jasmine vine.

A single bed on a sturdy wood frame is fitted with clean white sheets and
a thick hand-quilted blanket; the blanket is a prize winner, the pattern
intricate and done in hues of dark blue and cream white.  On the wall hangs
a framed photograph of a thirteen year old Marie Bettencourt, awkward but
beaming into the camera with a large blue ribbon from the local fair.  The
quilt is on the wall behind her.  The wide window looks out over the back
yard, a few acres of free growing knee-high grasses and wild lavender.  The
trees that border the property loom high into the skyline, several centuries
old and draped with Spanish Moss.  A tire swing on an old rope hangs from
the only tree left in the yard itself.  The guest bedroom has tidy white
curtains and a small washroom through a wood door.  This is the only bedroom
on the second floor that doesn't lock from the inside.

A sheer panel of Venetian lace is fitted over the French doors to the
east, leading out of the half-circular terrace and back into the house.  The
terrace is painted red but that's hard to see; the entire railing and all
the protective slats are grown over with thick ropes of kuzdu and star
jasmine vine, even a fern or two adding fanned branches to the wall of wild
greenery.  The terrace floor is salmon colored brick.  A reclining wooden
sunning chair with white cushions sits beside a matching patio table.  A
book with a green ribbon in the pages to keep track of progress sits on the
table.  Over the edge of the railing the Bettencourt grounds extend, in
places growing unchecked with knee-high grass and dandelions and in others
well-tended and beautiful, holding herb gardens and bushels of many-colored
roses.  The murky dark of the bayou is visible just past the border of the
white picket fence.

#cA side road through Mandeville#n~
The picturesque quality of Main Street dissolves rapidly down the side
streets of Mandeville.  The shotgun style houses are ramshackle with
overgrown yards, peeling paint and bars over the narrow windows.  A thick
fog hangs over the area, muffling all sounds and turning even familiar
landmarks into vague, alien shapes.  The pale, watery light manages to
alleviate the gloom only marginally.  A fluttering breeze can occasionally
be felt, rustling through the bits of paper garbage on the street then
whispering away.  A chainlink fence frames a wide, unpaved dirt lot to the
north, where a brick bar buzzes with music and neon. #r Vaughn's#n features
a sign painted on a wood pallet, a large wolf paw in white with the name of
the bar in red across the center. A shallow, beaten path to the east leads 
to a stonework fence line. Beyond the fence is a brightly-stained, cedar 
cottage, surrounded by flora.

#rVaughn's <Avg. NPCs: 9>#n~
Inside the brick dive bar the walls are paneled in fragrant wood beams. 
Neon signs advertising beer and booze hang all over the place and filter
their unnatural glow through the hanging haze of smoke.  A large pool table
with a green velvet top sits centered in the room, with thick, ornately
carved lion's paw feet made of coppery wood.  Over the table is a glass
Budweiser shade filled with dim flourescent bar lights.  The table is
quarter operated, fifty cents for a game, and cues and little cubes of blue
chalk are provided on a rack nearby.  The bar itself is immensely long,
running the full length of two walls in an L-shape, made from heavy wood
with a fine, aged patina and set with a multitude of padded red leather
stools.  Booths crowd into another wall, and a few tables pepper the main
floor.  An old juke box that plays records is aglow with pastel light near
the doors to the restrooms.  An unusual touch for a dive bar, paper menus
are stacked on the tables, in the booths and on the edge of the bar, listing
the meal options the cook can provide; it's mostly meat.  Steaks, burgers,
even hot dogs, served up with a basket of fresh fries.  The smells of
roasting flesh and fry oil fill the bar.

#yFeltner Designs, Boutique#n~
Entering into this contemporary styled boutique the walls are lined with
mirrors only separated by shelves displaying various accessories one would
add to their outfit.  The wooden floor spans across the boutique with a
large white polar bear skin spread nicely in front of two large plush
chairs.  Mannequins are displayed neatly around the store garbed in various
dresses or shirts tailoring to both the female and male clientele.  Two
pillars stand supporting a archway that is covered in ivy and various
flowers.  Various types of jewelry is on display within the glass counter
along the back wall, and behind it boots and shoes alike don the shelves.  A
door leading upstairs sits directly in the back corner of the store.

#yAbove Feltner Designs#n~
This room is scattered with various fabrics of all sorts, and looks as
though a natural disaster had occurred.  Placed upon a dais is a large
king-size canopy bed, sheer fabric draped from post to post.  Two large bay
windows display the life and intensity of the Italian Village and the
various pubs and restaurants that line the street.  Decorated around the
room are pictures of all sorts, displaying icons from the entertainment
industry to political figures.  A large life size painting mounts the wall
upon entering the room displaying some exotic flowers rising to the sun's
light, and shedding the few dewdrops that gently rested on the petals. 
Standing over the two flowers is a large tower of crystal, it's form
shimmering with the sunlight.

#rA mid-century house on Toulouse Street#n~
The older brick interior is covered with dry wall and eggshell white
texturing in a vain attempt to modernize the mid-century home, matching the
beige carpet.  A long bay window covers the wall that looks out to Toulouse
Street, with honey wood Venetian blinds behind a set of French Colonial
draperies, simple beige linen with a warm red panel accent, and the wood of
the window frame painted black to contrast the white of the walls and bright
color of the accent panel.  A flat screen television is closed away inside a
honey wood armoire, the drawers all filled with movies that have been
organized by the color of their spines.  A row of colored glass bottles sit
on the window sill holding bright red silk poppies, and the coffee table
that separates the sofa from the walkspace between it and the television is
home to a beige runner and wicker basket where the remote control and other
oddiments are stored.  Three giant red silk flowers are leaning against the
wall next to the armoire.  A large, comfortable blue recliner that doesn't
match much else about the living room sits in its own corner, with end table
marred by a few moisture rings beside it.  The chocolate suede couch
stretches over the wall opposite the television with a patchwork quilt
folded over one arm, and a few throw pillows add a splash of bright color to
the cushions.  The kitchen is around the corner through an open walkway, and
a staircase between the living room and the kitchen leads up through a
narrow hall to the upper story.

#rA mid-century house, second story hallway#n~
The walls of the hallway and stairs were left alone when the house was
modernized, leaving the old brick exposed.  A light fixture hangs down from
the sloped ceiling at an angle with an upturned opaque shade.  The second
story hall holds three doors painted eggshell white, nicely contrasting the
rich red brick of the walls, and between the doors are a few black collage
picture frames containing the same stock images they held in the store they
were purchased from.  The one at the end of the hall opens into the master
bedroom, the largest room in the house.  Getting there requires passing by
the bathroom and, across from that, a smaller guest room.  The hall is
covered with the same beige carpet as the lower floor.

#rA mid-century house, the master bedroom#n~
A double bed with a set of pale pink sheets and a generous cream coverlet
embroidered with a floral design in bold red thread sits opposite the door,
pushed up against and centered on the wall.  Behind it a mirror has been
mounted and draped with white faerie lights, the bulbs of which have been
covered with small paper lanterns.  There is a wide dresser spanning along
another wall, filled with neatly folded men's clothing and a few odds and
ends on top - some loose change, a Zippo lighter, a couple business cards
and a set of keys.  A few colorful shelving units form a geometric pattern
above the dresser.  Most nights a black leather holster is draped over the
top corner of the highest box shelf.  An NOPD badge on a matching leather
mount is slid into the holster instead of the sidearm that is noticeably
absent.  A small bottle of aftershave and an electric razor with the cord
wrapped around it sits on the dresser.  On a white bedside table with a
single drawer sits a set of neatly folded women's pajamas and a pink
cellphone.  To the east a wide bay window opens to the sky, looking out over
the French Quarter through tidy red curtains and honey wood blinds.  A
couple neatly crafted origami tulips sit on the windowsill.

#rA mid-century house, the guest room#n~
The dark red brick walls are accented by the eggshell carpet and soft
white gingham curtains.  The twin bed has a burnished brass frame with four
posts, and clean, powder blue sheets with matching pillow cases make up the
mattress.  The quilt is a handmade affair, folded at the foot, an
amalgamation of many soft fabrics and patterns.  On the windowsill have been
set three small clay pots filled with rich soil; tiny green sprouts have
begun to push through the surface, one with the smallest little lavender bud
blooming near the end.  A battered suitcase covered in stickers is slid
underneath the bed, holding a few personal effects and some small pieces of
women's clothing.  The closet has been filled with similar items of female
attire, none of it new, but all well taken care of.  Several paper flowers
sit on a stout oak dresser.

#gSheehan Restorations - Grounds#n~
Behind a fence that partially obscures the view of the grounds sits an
old red brick building constructed in the 1800s.  An arched set of black
wooden double doors leads into the main room of the shop on the first floor.
Large windows with white lattice work and arched tops look out over the
front and rear grounds.  Thick black shutters of heavy wood remain open most
of the year, though can be closed up to protect the glass during storms. 
Toward the rear of the building, it seems as though there is additional shop
and storage space beyond the main facade.  The grounds themselves are
surrounded by old growth trees.  There is a smaller front yard with room for
cars to park and then a more extensive area in the back.  Toward the edges,
the grass grows long and creeps up between numerous items, some covered up,
some uncovered, treasures waiting to be restored to their former glory,
perhaps.  Off to the side of the building is set of covered steps that lead
up to the second story of the building.  A sign with gold lettering on a
dark red background hangs above the main door which reads " Sheehan
Restorations" in bold letters.

#gSheehan Restorations  Main Shop#n~
Well-lit and meticulously kept, the main room of the shop has newly
restored hardwood floors and cases of polished glass that showcase various
items that have been worked on by the proprietor.  The cases line three of
the four walls of the shop with an opening that leads back behind the
counter area to the workshop beyond.  Windows in the front allow in some
natural light and a view of the outside world.  In the center of the
spacious room sit a few larger items that don't fit within the cabinets. 
The lighting allows for a clear view of the items on display without being
harsh or glaring.  Behind the counter at the rear of the room is a cash
register as well as a display case with some smaller items as well as all
the usual licenses and permits that are necessary for a business to have on
display.  A heavy set of metal doors lead to the back of the shop which
remain closed most of the time.  When they open and close during business
hours, one can often hear the sounds of the shop machinery in the
background.

#gSheehan Restorations  Apartment#n~
Insulated from the noise of the shop below, the second story of the front
of the old brick building has been converted into a spacious apartment. 
Most of the walls have been left as they were, allowing the exposed brick to
show through, only the dividing walls between rooms covered in drywall and
painted muted neutral colors so as not to take away from the original
architecture.  In the ceiling of the main living area, a giant set of old
gears still remain from the building's history as some sort of mill.  Large
windows allow light to pour in as well as a beautiful view of New Sussex and
the grounds.  The large open living area flows into a modern kitchen filled
with new appliances and ample space for cooking.  A large screen television
sits against one wall and comfortable thick couches and chairs allow a
perfect view of the screen.  Across from the kitchen in what might have been
a dining area sits a billiards table, instead.  Down the hall there are a
couple of other rooms including the master bedroom with its own large bath
and a guest bed and bathroom, one door on either side of the hall.

#gSheehan Restorations  Workshop#n~
The long addition on the back of the brick building contains three
separate areas.  The first, and largest area is that of the workshop itself.
Tools of all shapes and sizes line the walls and are contained within
rolling chests, cabinets, and some free standing large machinery has its own
area of the shop.  The floors are a stained concrete and a large set of
rolling metal doors can be lifted to allow entire vehicles, boats, or other
large objects to be brought directly into the workshop from outside.  The
area is well lit and safety equipment is available.  This area, like the
front of the shop, is kept meticulously clean even though it is well used. 
It appears that all of the tools and equipment are well cared-for.  A cargo
elevator with a locked control panel sits off to the side and kept clear of
debris.  The smallest area contains the office and its adjacent storage room
that contains everything that a small business might need in order to
maintain its operations from computers to filing cabinets.  The third area
is a separate room that is sealed off and soundproofed.  The long narrow
room serves as a firing range for testing out restored weaponry.  It
consists of an observation area divided from the rest of the room by a thick
pane of bulletproof glass and a similarly reinforced door.

#eParish of the Holy Guardian Angels#n~
This building looks like it was constructed a hundred years ago, even
though it was done in the last twenty.  The white-washed walls rise high up
to the oval ceiling, four marble archways spanning from the northern wall to
the southern, with two crimson banners dangling from each individual beam. 
Each banner has a golden cross embossed with silk, and the ends dangle ten
feet up from the floor.  The same banners line each of the walls, placed
between various paintings or stained glass windows depicting the Virgin
Mary, a nativity scene, or some other scene of religious importance.  The
largest of these, is a twenty foot by nine stained glass window with The
Crucifiction on it.  Three columns of pews are lined up from the entrance of
the parish, with twenty rows to each column.  Red carpet runs between each
column of oak pews, and stopping once they reach the marble steps up to the
altar.  For light, the parish has a few chandeliers dangling from the
ceiling between the marble archways, and a dozen or so candle holders lining
the edges of the room.  The altar itself is made of cherry, which has a
clear glaze and no staining to add to the color.  A white, felt cloth is
draped over the altar, with two large candles resting on the corners and a
large, ancient looking bible resting center of it.  There are six or so
candles lining the platform that the altar rests on, three on each side, and
standing nearly eight feet in height.  The final piece in all of this, is a
gold plated cross that stands before the stained glass window, standing
eight and a half feet in height.  To the west, lies the twin doors to a
redwood confessional.  To the south, is a simple oak door that leads to a
supply closet, accessible down a short flight of steps.

#eThe Supply Closet#b~
This simple closet is not much to look at, because a closet does not need
to be as fancy or appealing as the rest of the establishment.  Inside, is an
assortment of cleaning supplies, from buckets and mops, to stain remover and
a small bucket of salt for those days that may, for some reason, cause the
stone pathway outside to ice up.  Some replacements for the banners,
candles, and even stain for the pews is held in this simple closet as well,
looks like the parish-priest wants to make sure that they are stocked for
any situation.  At the back of the closet, is a painting of an angel in
golden armor, a silver broadsword clasped in the beings hands with the seven
virtues etched onto the blade.

The walls of this particular room are plated in stainless steel, no
visible smears or scratches on any of the metallic plates.  Four reinforced
steel doors stick out from the steel walls, with a small bronze plaque next
to each.  The southern door reads "AM", the eastern door reads "CC", a door
down a brief set of stairs reads, "HC", and the western door reads, "LB and
BH".

The walls of this room are lined with steel plating, each one unmarked
and fairly new.  A long weapons rack lines the western wall of this room, a
shotgun and a pair of pistols held in it's grasp, along with a few boxes of
ammo for each on the shelf below.  A long table runs along the north wall,
an assortment of knives, batons, stakes, and nails lie scattered across it,
along with a single hammer.  The eastern wall has seven shelves bolted to
it, holding the odds and ends that the residents own.  This ranges from body
bags, duct tape, and earplugs all the way to electronic amplifiers and
thermal imaging cameras.  The very bottom shelf on the eastern wall, holds
three toolboxes.  Each box has a label, the first being 'Replacement gun
parts', the second being 'sharpening stones and grinders', and the third and
final one reads 'Misc tools'.

#eCommand Center#n~
The walls of this room are painted a dark, ocean blue, causing the room
to feel smaller than what it actually is.  Overhead, are five tube lights,
each one five feet in length and illuminating a small portion of the room,
only together do they manage to illuminate the entire area.  A single, red
colored light rests in the center of the ceiling, illuminating whenever one
of the various security devices of the complex is triggered.  Three large,
oak tables form a triangle in the center of the room, a desktop computer set
up on each, and linked to a central router and database that lies between
them.  Against the northern wall, rests a small school desk with the base
station for a cordless phone sitting on it.  Pinned to the eastern wall, are
three massive maps.  One of the entire world, one of the U.  S.  A, and one
of New Orleans.  Below the map of New Orleans, is a six foot long rosewood
table with dozens of maps piled up on it, most of them for the various
quarters of the city and any land that lies within twenty miles outside the
city.  The final wall of the room, the southern, has another table placed
against it, this one only four feet in length.  A small, plasma screen TV
sits on top of it.  The screen is broken into five sections, each showing a
live feed from a security camera hidden in the various rooms.

#eThe Library#n~
Not a single wall can be spotted in this room, due to the massive
bookshelves that are bolted to them that span around the room.  There are
easily a thousand or more books in this room, each one categorized by type,
rather than the authors name or the title of the book.  One section of the
shelves might be labeled 'vampires', and another 'werewolves', where some
simply say 'pagan' or 'classic literature'.  Sat in the center of the room,
on top of the plus green carpet, is a large, circular table that has a
diameter of eight feet across.  In the center of the table, is a small CV
radio and a normal, old fashioned radio.  Just in case they needed to
contact the police, or wished to simply listen to some music while browsing
the texts.  Six plush, leather armchairs sit around this table in case
anyone would like to sit and read in comfort.  On the ceiling, are a dozen
of LED lamps, ensuring that hardly any shadows are allowed to exist in the
room, and providing an excessive amount of light to read in.  The northern
wall has a simple oak door on it, which rests between two of the book cases.
A plaque above the door reads "BH".

This room his fairly simple compared to the rest of the others, in terms
of what lies inside of it.  The walls are covered in a durable white cloth
with thick padding behind it, to ensure whoever occupies the room does not
thrash about and hurt themselves.  A small, twin sized mattress rests
against the eastern wall, covered in white sheets and a thick, white
comforter for warmth.  The western wall has a small toilet and sink attached
to it, both made out of steel, and having buttons installed on them to work
the water.  The door on the northern wall is made of thick steel, with a
slider on the top and middle of the door to allow someone to peek in or
slide a tray of food to the occupant.  Stairs lie outside the door.

#eThe Bunkhouse#n~
This is perhaps the most welcoming room in the entire complex, and the
most relaxing.  The four walls of this room are painted to look like a
grassy meadow with a slightly cloudy sky above.  Thick green carpet lines
the floor, to compliment the painted walls and carry on the meadow theme. 
Four full sized beds rest inside the bunkhouse, each one with a thick blue
curtain that can be pulled around the bed for privacy.  A moderately sized
chest rests at the foot of each bed for storage, and a small dresser stands
near the head of the beds to provide a place to hang ones spare clothing. 
Just above the southern door, is a large LED TV, providing some sort of
entertainment to those hunters staying in the bunkhouse, and it even has
cable to boot!  A stainless steel door rests against the northern wall,
leading off to a full bathroom with a standing shower, a large bathtub, an
onyx sink and toilet combo, and a large vanity mirror to groom ones self.

#pSouthern Terrace of Chateau de Augustin#n~
A stone arbour forms a shaded passageway around the main terrace. 
Vertical pillars support cross beams and a sturdy open lattice upon which
woody vines and magenta bougainvillea are trained.  The floor is speckled
with the petals of flowers and intermittent leaves, swept across neatly
fitted stones and mortar.  The main entrance to the villa is accessible at a
central point, where the arbour opens to the open sky and a pair of large
iron-banded doors are latched.  A smattering of tactful stone benches with
ornately embroidered red cushions are placed on the terrace.  At the
furthest eastern point is a lattice coop with a few cooing lovebirds perched
on living withies.  The enclosure is open to the air to the east, and has a
small door with a copper latch toward the terrace.

#gYard before a cedar cottage#n~
Stepping through the wooden gate of the stone work fencing, the front
yard of the cottage is a masterful work of landscaping with a variety of
stones and plant life.  The outside of the boxy building is modestly
decorated; a few flower boxes perch outside of each, open faced window,
displaying a number of blooms with the season permits.  The original path of
hardened, foot-stamped soil continues its trail toward a couplet of steps
and a tiny, railed in porch.  A humming bird feeder, full of colored sugar
water, dangles from the eave of the landing, inviting the flitting creatures
to stop and sup at their leisure.  A solid looking door, stained a darker
wash than the rest of the building, and trimmed with dull-brass fixtures,
opens into the building proper.

#gLiving room of a cedar cottage#n~
When one enters the home, they are instantly greeted with the cozy
feeling of roughin it with all the creature comforts anyone could ask
for.  The main living area is open and roomy, housing a set of leather
furniture, all placed around a coffee table and facing an entertainment
system, fitted with television, stereo system, and a few game consoles, both
old generation and new.  Along a side wall is a smooth, stone fireplace, the
hearth being blocked off safely by a metal screen and sliding glass door. 
Setting atop the mantle are a few framed pictures of the home owners, both
smiling happily, a mixture of visions from their High School days, up to the
point of a few wedding stills.  Separated by an island is the kitchen area,
the space now doubling as two rooms in one.  The kitchen is basic, with
cabinets lining the upper walls, along with lower storage units under the
tile work counters.  A dual standing washer and dryer is set off to the side
of a massive refrigerator, the unit, itself, hidden away behind a closet
door fixed to match the wood texture and grain of the rest of the kitchen
fixtures.  A set of French doors to the north leads to a lush garden
outside, as a hallway stretches out to the east.

The same wood paneling flows from the living room down the hall,
connecting the wide, open space, to a much smaller section of the home.  The
walls house a few pictures here and there, some meaningful while others are
nothing but filler.  A coat closet is nestled along the walk way, and to the
east is another opening that leads to the master bedroom.

#gGarden behind a cedar cottage#n~
A heavenly oasis of all growing things flourishes behind the fenced in
cottage.  From vegetables to herbs, from trees to fruits, if it can grow in
the climate permitted, it has and would continue to do so.  Attentively
tended to soil houses line after line of green, leafy things, all marked
with small wooden posts where necessary.  Not even a single blade of grass
is allowed to be out of place, as the calm, peaceful area is kept in a
pristine fashion at all times, no matter the season.  Surrounded by woven
grape vines is an old, fashionably tarnished swinging chair.  The chains
groan and creek upon use, creating a relaxing lullaby of a good piece of
outdoor furniture.  A chipped birdbath, probably there when the building was
originally constructed, stands slanted, partially sinking into the earth.

#gMaster Bedroom#n~
At the far end of the cottage rests the master bedroom.  The space is
well kept and is usually clear of any clutter.  A king size bed is the main
focal point of the room, the wood frame hugging in the large mattress and
box spring as downy bedding of sheets, blankets, and a topped off comforter
support a few select pillows that are unmistakably used and worn in by their
owners.  A nightstand sits along either side of the bed, one housing an
alarm clock and lamp, as the other has a set of folders and stacked
paperwork with a mishmash of stickers and scented markers.  A large
dresser/vanity combo sits along a side wall, and a flat screen TV hangs from
the open wall space across from the foot of the bed.  All windows of the
area are blocked off with heavy curtains, as natural light is allowed into
the sleeping area by way of a set of skylights lining the A shaped
ceiling.  A walk in closet is also visible, hidden away by sliding shutter
doors.

#cStudio apartment over Vaughn's bar#n~
The studio above Vaughn's looks about like one would expect for an
apartment over a small-town dive bar.  The plaster walls have exposed wires
and the bulb that hangs down from the middle of the ceiling is naked. 
Clothes that would look about right on a modern teenager are strewn all over
the place, as are a couple editions of TeenPop magazine and a few dozen
bottles of nail polish.  There is a pyramid of Budweiser cans stacked up
under the only window and posters of rock legends tacked on the walls in
varying positions - rarely straight, usually diagonal.  Even the ceiling has
been papered with posters.  The bed is a simple twin on a nice teak frame,
unmade and messy as the rest of the place, but clean.  A Playgirl magazine
is stowed under the pillow.  There is no shower, but an antique ivory
bathtub with gold feet in one corner, surrounded by a pull curtain.  A
stuffed unicorn is sitting on the bed, thoroughly worn-in by squishing.

#pYesteryears [Hedge Market Shop]#n~
Eerie pale green witchlights hover near the low earthen ceiling, gently
bobbing and swaying in an unfelt breeze.  The entire shop is crammed into a
hole in the side of the hill, reminiscent of a halfling residence from
Tolkien's Shire, walls made of fitted gray and brown stone, floor well-worn
and fragrant wood with a complex grain.  A stout counter divides the shop in
half, running from one wall to the other; behind it are a maze of shelves of
varying sizes and shapes, some diagonal or even vertical, the contents
defying what some would call gravity.  Thousands of tiny bottles gleam with
colored potions, corks stuck in top and hand-penned labels.  There are
baskets filled with stacks of scroll paper envelopes that have been sealed
with a wax stamp, packaged poultices, intricate cornucopias overflowing with
bizarre fresh fruits in every color and shape, some with delicious odors and
others foul.  An iron pot sits on the counter, a wooden spoon moving slowly
through the bubbling blue liquid.  Strings of popcorn garlands decorate the
eaves and for whatever reason a crooked Christmas tree draped with pastel
lights sits near the door.  The low hum of We Will Rock You beats through
the shop from sources unknown.  Behind the counter is a wide circular door
made from wood panels with a brass knob in the very center.  By pressing
against the eastern wall one finds they can step right through it.

`bSisters of Saint John Convent - Courtyard and Gardens`C (`wHoly Ground`C:`w 2`C)`n~
Slender cobbled paths lead through small, well tended shrub gardens, with
several crumbling, pale stone fountains of once elegantly carved religious
figures, their ample bowls filled with moist black soil and used as planters
for Daffodil and Easter Lily bulbs.  A grassy knoll near the brick wall than
encloses the compound holds an old, freshly white-washed swing set with new
leather strap seating and bright steel chains.  To the north is an old stone
church with boarded up windows that have been covered with a cage of
expanded steel.  Off to the right, a safe distance from the dilapedated
chapel is the new complex, a palazzo-styled one story building in a distinct
L shape.  The bright crimson shingled roof curves down around the light
beige brick structure, suspending a drapes of spanish moss and thick
flowering vines that form a hugging coat of greenery, tended back away from
windows and doors.  The large front doors are of a honey colored polished
wood, and a spire near the back of the complex is topped with a large bronze
cross.

#pYesteryears Curiosities (Avg. NPCs: 1)#n~
A little one-room shop with faded brick walls lined by tidy shelves,
potions, herbs, remedies and dried fruits organized neatly for display. 
Strings of white faerie lights drape down from the exposed oak beams in the
ceiling, and a single antique lamp made of tarnished brass sits on the long
counter that divides the shop in half.  Warm shimmers of light gleam from
the thousands of bottles and vials, the contents a broad pallet of colored
fluid.  Oddities from bygone eras are set on a few mid-height shelves for
perusal, including a broad collection of curious wind-up toys from the
Industrial Era and a stack of yellowed playing cards with burlesque ladies
on the backs.  There is a plethora of gaudy antique jewelry on a turning
stand placed near the cash register, and a red glass bowl of Gobstoppers. 
Nothing is labelled or priced.  A big, heavy antique cash register sits on
the stout oak counter, noisy and difficult to operate.  The floor is made of
neatly fitted redwood panels with a complex grain, swept very clean despite
the dust that's had centuries to settle deep into the cracks.  A brass bell
over the door jingles when it opens, and a brightly colored rug made of
upcycled tee shirts sits before the counter. Behind the counter is a wide 
circular door made from wood panels with a brass knob in the very center,
leading to a dusty staircase.

`bSisters of Saint John Convent - Waiting Room`C (`wHoly Ground`C:`w 2`C)`n~
A dark wood desk enclosed by a stucco walled alcove handles admissions,
counseling and all else, taking what information the patients or those who
brought them are willing to offer before accepting and admitting individuals
for care.  A few neutral pieces of framed artwork line the walls, mostly
photography of nature or the French Quarter by one of the resident Sisters. 
A clean light colored wood flooring houses a small enclosed play area with
safe plastic toys, buckets of crayons and coloring books, and comfortable
wooden chairs arranged against the walls with magazine racks installed
against their legs.  A nurses station is near the entrance, with a single
computer and old fashioned ivory plastic telephone with a long curly cord. 
The heavy double wooden doors to the west lead out into the gardens and
courtyard, and a locked door to the east opens only from the inside.
Beyond it lies a wide hallway with a dark navy wallpaper, a standing scale
and sealed single-use thermometers organized in a sterile container. 
Several doors line the hall, leading into seperate treatment or examination
rooms, each with a clipboard hung upon the door.  A large tapestry depicting
Christ's ascenion into heaven drapes across the northern wall, covering a
wide portion.

#gHailee's Hollow Garden #e[Workshop 3]#n~
A vast landscape overlooked by pristine blue skies and big billows of
white clouds houses acres of neatly tilled earth, planter boxes that rise up
off the ground with sides painted bright colors, even a greenhouse that
appears to be constructed of stained glass, glimmering radiantly in the
perpetual sun.  The landscape slopes and dips to place some rows of crops in
the light and others in the shade; the fluffs of cloud are still and provide
notes of shade to other portions.  Dozens of strains of hedge fruit grow in
organized sections, jutting up out of the ground in wiry stalks, curling up
with vines around braces, filling up bushels or lying on the earth like
melons.  A fenced-off section with an unsettling scarecrow hanging from a
stake holds what looks like a pumpkin patch, though what grows among the
hedgerows are vibrant and pink instead of orange.  Wood buckets with iron
strappings are placed here and there, filled with dying weeds and tools. 
There is a burlap sack containing a strange, shimmering substance with a
consistency like sand beside the greenhouse.  Walking to the west one comes
to an invisible, soft barrier that hangs in the air like a film.  Pressing
beyond it leaves the unwary stumbling into a small shop.

bottles of antibacterial hand cleanser are on one side of the room, and an
overhead light attached to an adjustable arm can be swung to any placement
above the bed.  A padded stool that can be rolled across the clean linoleum
flooring is beside the bed, and a large locked teak cabinet holds gowns,
drapes and sterile, individually sealed instruments.  A heavy plastic bin is
installed to one wall, marked with the bright yellow biohazard symbol.

#bA mid-century house, bathroom#n~
The entire bathroom is tiled, from the floor to the walls to the ceiling,
and the sparkling white cleanliness is interrupted only by the occasional
accent of a small, navy blue square.  The fixtures are polished brass, all
perfectly maintained save the one over the pedastal sink, which still only
has a couple spots of toothpaste on the faucet.  The shower and bath
combination unit is white with the same brass fixtures as the sink.  The
curtain that can be pulled to keep the water in the shower is clear plastic
with no ornaments, and a thick microfiber rug sits on the floor beside the
bath to soak up wet feet as they step out of it.  A bottle of antibacterial
hand soap and a pump that dispenses hand sanitizer sit on either side of the
sink.  The mirror opens to reveal a wood shelving unit filled with first aid
supplies and a couple bottles of over the counter pain killers.  A brass
cannister holding honey oatmeal bath salts sits between the toilet and the
bath with a little wooden scoop stowed inside.  Fresh white towels are
folded neatly over the rack.

#RA#rpartment 2C, The #RS#raint Phillips Apartments#n~
Eggshell white walls are bare.  The decor in the apartment is so spartan
it's a stretch to think anybody lives here - there's furniture, sure, but
it's just a couch.  A nice couch.  It's made of soft, ivory suede and stands
raised on carved mahogany legs.  A chestnut armoire holds a plasma
television and several drawers filled with films, a smattering of them
pornographic.  The royal blue carpet is thick and new, freshly vacuumed with
the lines still running through from where the machines' brushes were pushed
and pulled.  The one bedroom is down a wide hallway, and the door hangs open
just enough to reveal an amalgamation of animal prints and crimson silks
draping down from the ceiling over the California King bed.  The kitchen
looks rarely used, far too clean and empty save a few cans of Pabst that
have been housed in an antique bread box.

This is a narrow hallway crafted of damp cobbled stone, with a ceiling
that slopes upward from door to the south to a broad opening westward.  The
hall is approximately twenty feet in length, with a hard, meticiulously
clean cement floor and a single light fixture affixed to the wall, it's long
extension cord trailing toward the west, into a fairly well-lit room.

`bSisters of Saint John Convent - Saint Paul Cathedral`C (`wHoly Ground`C:`w 2`C)`n~
The interior of this once extravagent cathedral has been ravaged by time
and disrepair, though the peeling and cracking plaster that hangs from the
walls has been recently tended to, poorly smoothed back into place or
repainted.  Piles of thick white dust signify where the results of the most
recent attempt to sweep have ended.  The fine cherrywood pews have been
polished and cleaned, pushed back into their proper places lining the church
in two rows of eighteen, and at the forefront mounted behind a freshly
stained wood altar is a stunning crucifix, composed of solid carved ivory
with delicate and meticulous realistic features.  The massive, narrow
stained glass windows that line the walls from front to back are intact and
have been cleaned, granting them a noteworthy sparkle.  A hallway behind and
to the right of the altar leads down to the basement, and the small wooden
door to the west bears a light hammered cross upon the panelling, marking it
as the confessional booth.

#gWalk-in closet in a cedar cottage#n~
One side of the closet has been completely cleared out and the contents
put in black trash bags that are tossed in the furthest corner.  The other
side is filled with neatly hung mens clothing, mostly button-up, pressed
shirs with stached collars and pairs of jeans.  Large mens shoes are
arranged in pairs beneath.  On the bare side of the closet two thick leather
straps hang from the rail where clothes hangers used to be, and an ash tray
with a few butts sits on the shelf.  The door is padlocked from the outside,
and there are no windows.  A single naked bulb overhead can be tugged on and
off with a string.

The center divider that would generally be in place to seperate confessor
from Priest has been removed, allowing the occupants to speak face to face. 
Several thick white candles with a pure burn provide warming light.  The
walls are very thick, assumedly sound proof.  A stout pew with a swing-down
wooden kneeling bar set with a thick linen-slippered pad is installed upon
either side.

`bSisters of Saint John Convent - Chapter House`C (`wHoly Ground`C:`w 2`C)`n~
Solid stone walls seal this warehouse space beneath the cathedral,
holding the marshy earth beyond easily at bay.  A large corporate styled
table in burnished oak is placed near the center of the area, covered in
papers and files, with nine wooden chairs pushed in around it, one at the
head.  Organized against the expanse of one entire wall is a series of six
identical steel framed desks, each holding a computer and a few typical
office supplies like datebooks and mechanical pencils.  Beside them,
organized into a small sitting space with a few squashy knit cushion chairs
enclosing it is a massive bookshelf stocked with texts both old and new.  An
array of angular, polished wooden cubical dividers lend privacy to four
sleeping areas, each one containing two twin beds with clean white linens,
an earth-green down blanket and a pillow.  A large steel cabinet with a lock
has been installed directly into the thick layers of stone that make up the
walls.  A kitchenette and living area with a television, DVD player, VCR,
stereo and other audio and video equipment fill an entire corner of the
warehouse.  A wide assortment of various unmatching furniture has been
scattered around the television.  A locker room with a bathroom has been
built into it's own side quarter, blocked from view by more wooden dividers
and it's own set of swinging shutter doors.  A portion tiled with painfully
clean white linoleum contains two hospital beds with life support machines
upon rolling tables, along with a cabinet or two filled with medical
supplies.  The stone of the southern wall has been removed and replaced with
concrete fixed with three solid steel doors, each crafted with a thin,
heavily barred window.  The cells beyond these doors are several feet lower
than the rest of the basement warehouse, allowing for a reinforced ceiling.

winding through the large pools of water and marshy ground.  Your vision of
what lies ahead is obfuscated by the numerous trees, hanging spanish moss
and the thick fog that snakes through the tree trunks and bushes.  A heavy
green smell fills your nostils and every few moments you hear something

#wBefore a large plantation house#n~
A large plantation style house rises out of the swampland here.  A large
porch with four white columns frames the front door.  There are two windows
on either side of the porch, and on the second story, five windows are
evenly placed across the front.  The house is painted an earthy tan, but
green stains from the swamp provide an odd visual texture.  The path makes a
circle here before the house, allowing one to turn around, and allowing for
the parking of several vehicles.  A large detatched garage that could easily
store five vehicles has been placed on the southernmost part of the circle.

dark leaves that curl and line each branch. A few black stone benches are
placed flush to the walls near the trees. Doors line the walls on all sides,
and at the very end of the atrium lies a massive, stone spiral staircase.

#eA large library and parlor#n~
Curved shelves composed of arched, sleek matte steel beams line the walls
of this massive, perfectly oval room completely, save for the opening that
gives way to an open, broad Gothic arch in black marble to the south.  Tomes
beyond count fill the shelves from top to bottom, leaving no space open for
storage of anything else upon the beams.  The floors are composed of wood in
the deepest cherry red, sanded perfectly smooth and fitted together with
narrow, interlocking square panels.  Squat four-legged chairs with plush
scarlet or black cushions are placed here and there throughout the ballroom
sized library, with small curling iron-tables topped in surfaces no larger
than a dinner plate.  Modern styled sconces in thin glass descend several
dozen feet from the vaulted ceilings, casting a warm glow throughout the
library suitable for reading in all hours in the night.  Iron ladders
attached in places to the shelves can be slid throughout the room, so that
the upper shelves that lie at twenty five or more feet from the ground may
be accessed.  The library continues to stretch out toward the east.

#eA large library and parlor#n~
Curved shelves composed of arched, sleek matte steel beams line the walls
of this massive, perfectly oval room completely, save for the opening that
gives way to an open, broad Gothic arch in black marble to the south.  Tomes
beyond count fill the shelves from top to bottom, leaving no space open for
storage of anything else upon the beams.  The floors are composed of wood in
the deepest cherry red, sanded perfectly smooth and fitted together with
narrow, interlocking square panels.  Squat four-legged chairs with plush
scarlet or black cushions are placed here and there throughout the ballroom
sized library, with small curling iron-tables topped in surfaces no larger
than a dinner plate.  Modern styled sconces in thin glass descend several
dozen feet from the vaulted ceilings, casting a warm glow throughout the
library suitable for reading in all hours in the night.  Iron ladders
attached in places to the shelves can be slid throughout the room, so that
the upper shelves that lie at twenty five or more feet from the ground may
be accessed.  The library continues to stretch out toward the west.

#eA large dining room#n~
A banquet table with sixteen chairs sits in the middle of this long,
candlelit room, and upon it sits a vase that holds four exquisitely smithed
iron-cast roses, and a set of bone china.  A scarlet runner covers the table
from head to foot, and an iron chandelier crafted of intricately curling
black iron descends from the ceiling, providing a dim, sultry light.

#eThe Kitchen#n~
A stainless steel refrigerator of massive proportions, range oven and a
butchers block line the main of the wallspace here.  The tiled floor is
spotless and well maintained.  A collection of decanters that hold spices
and other necessary cooking items rest beside a deep steel sink.  A brass
fitted, rather ornate espresso maker sits upon a side board, and a bar with
several variations of alcohol has been installed beside a six-foot concealed
counter-topped deep freezer.  A huge wine rack with a endless vintages of
stock wine and champagne is tucked beneath a cubby hole.  The counters and
black and have been dotted randomly with tuscan tiles, and the ceiling is
Victorian tin.  Every major appliance has been somehow concealed within the
finely crafted Italian cabinets, and all of the wood in entire kitchen is
dark cherrywood.

lined with thick tomes, and other such items. The flooring is black, solid 
marble, and a large chandelier hangs regally overhead. Doors lead north 
and south. A large set of double doors stands at the end of the corridor 
to the east.

`eA small, cold sitting room`n~
The solid black marble of the floor tapers off here into thick sheet
metal.  The walls are bare and lined with flame-retardant material that
gives off a faint reflective sheen, and the furniture consists of many
modern styled couches and chairs, each set with an accompanying circular
iron table no larger than an average briefcase.  Books occasionally dot
tables, but most are clean and tidy, empty but for those beside furniture
currently bearing occupants.  Bookshelves in solid iron stretch from wall to
wall and ceiling to floor, lined with tomes of all sorts and endless
supplies of what would appear to be lab or ritual equipment.  A gothic arch
in the eastern wall opens to reveal a small, dark cavity before a closed
metal door.

each bearing double mattresses of thick goose-down.  Heavy blankets of
velvet and sheets of fine Egyptian cotton have been laden over each

wall farthest from the wall, encircled in heavy velvet coverings that can be
pulled to a close by the tug of a gold tassel near the head.  A few pieces
of elegant furniture dot the room, consisting of a large mahogany desk,
wingbacked chairs, a circular table between the chairs and a nightstand
beside the bed.  Upon the nightstand sits a pair of rimless reading glasses
and a crystal vial filled with luminescent red fluid.  The walls are covered
with tapestries or black and white photographs depicting various scenes in
Moscow, Russia, each bearing a thin silver plate describing the contents of
the picture.  A massive armoire of carved mahogany sits in a corner with a
wooden screen blocking off a portion of space not far away.

This labratory is far different then what most would expect to see in a
room for scientific resarch.  Filling the entire attic of this large house,
this lab is illuminated by eight glowing spheres suspended in the air.  No
windows or vents pierce the walls, which are covered in a flat grey paint. 
Three wooden tables, scorched and worn, offer a work area, while dozens of
shelves hold books, phials, and jars.  A steep stair leads back downstairs.

`eAn abandoned meat packing plant`n~
Row upon row of thick, sharp hooks line the ceiling of this large, long
warehouse between the hazy glow of the few still working bulbs, some of
which flicker in and out of life while others sit dark and empty.  Large
dulled chrome spillways stretch out beneath the rows of hooks, carving
stark, straight lines through the dull matte of the dark green tiled floor,
the steel troughs being stained with what is obviously the remnants of
blood.  The place is obviously a meat packing plant of some kind, though
unused judging by the lack of pig carcass.  Opposite the entrance, crossing
the long, rectangular warehouse, there is a metal shutter which presumably
leads to a space outside while two thick steel doors glimmer against the
brickwork, crowned with the words 'Deep Freeze.  '

#oB#yambu#o A#ysian#o G#yrille #o& S#yushi#o B#yar#n~
The inside of Bambu is dimly lit, with a hint of blue flouresence to
the modern setting of this Japanese restaurant.  The walls are partially
covered in a rough brownish twill-patterned wallpaper, some parts of it just
painted dark brown and panelled over with smooth rectangular wood accents at
designated intervals.  Sleek wooden tables supported on shiny ebony metal
legs seat four to a table, the setting on them clean and spartan, with a
folded napkin and accompanying bamboo chopsticks in paper packets.  A
tube-like cerulean light attached to each wooden panel shines down on the
table placed next to it.  The menu is similar to any Japanese restaurant --
with colorful laminated menus in both English and Japanese, and photographs
of exotic sushi and other dishes littered across the crisp typesetting of
the menu.  The establishment serves mostly traditional dishes -- ramen and
soba, familiar rice bowls and teppanyaki, to sashimi and sushi.  The counter
is a long length of flat wood, dilligently wiped and facing a clear glass
refrigerated compartment where slabs of fresh raw fish are placed on a
synthetic green sheet; salmon, tuna and octopus, even plastic bowls of raw 
fish eggs.  Beer and sake are available, the latter denoted by the large
burlap and rope barrels stacked up in a conspicious corner.

`gHigh ground`n~
With a slight grade a small rise provides a bit more stable ground in
this part of the swamp.  The press of willow and cypress eases and the trees
grow a bit farther apart.  The foliage isn't quite so thick and along the
edge of a waterway is a large clear area where alligators might sun
themselves if no one was about to disturb their sleep.  A loud bird call can
be heard and the ever present noise of insects and frogs.  A broad clearing
opens here, and a cairn of stones is built at the direct center, surrounding
a tall, seven-foot wooden totem of an intricately detailed, carved feather. 
The feather seems to just stick into the ground, but close inspection would
prove that it has a wooden supporting base to keep it from toppling over.

#gAudubon Nature Institute#n~
A few buildings of five to six stories in height are placed in a planned
layout amidst what seems to be a peaceful forest of tall cypresses and
maintained grass lawns.  Pavements link each building to each other, large
plastic plaques on each of these buildings indicate the departments and
facilities available in them.  Electric lampposts line most of the
pavements, keeping them lighted.  The buildings themselves have large
windows, some of which dark, while others, an encased flourescent glow emits
from them.  A large parking lot is found near to the entrance into the
building, a paybooth with a barricade stationed at the exit.  The Institute
is fenced in by a tall, dark brown metal fence running around the entire
perimeter.

A ragged cheap couch sits off to the side with a small television off on
a stand in front of it.  Cheap carpeting is hard underfoot and the living
room seems to be seperated by the kitchen by an island counter.  In the
kitchen a small refridgerator can be seen in the hole designated for it
under a cabinet overhead.  The cabinets of the kitchen stretch all around,
opening only for the gas stove and sink and cooking utensils can be seen
hanging all about the wall.

across, adjacent from the sink over the white tiled floor.

`oReception Lobby at The Ambassador Hotel `y(`oAvg NPCs`y:`o 10`y)`n~
Unpainted brick surfaces in warm shades of red make up most of the walls
in the reception lobby of the Ambassador Hotel.  Filled up with comfortable
seating, simple chairs and monochrome couches where tourists with their
luggage and locals could wait around or just relax.  The flooring is fully
carpeted in forest-green and dark red feathering.  The oiled oak paneling
and crystal-edged windows in sixteen panels, set upon folding French doors
leading to the outside of the hotel lend a nostalgic edge to the demeanor of
the establishment.  The reception counter is in heavy oak and lines one long
portion of the reception area, currency and room rates in beeping computer
screens behind on the wall.  Cheerfully-dressed receptionists and duty
personnel are on duty at all times, providing room rental services, as well
as affordable concierge and valet services.  To the west, the raucous sounds
of Azul's Restaurant and Lounge drifts into the lobby at regular intervals. 
The hotel's two elevators can be accessed from the east, a bell-boy ready to
help a guest with their luggage.

The quiet hotel landing is covered with the same forest-green and dark
red floor carpet and usually soft strains of music would travel through the
main announcement system.  The elevators bleep quietly, as they travel up
and down the different floors to serve one hundred and sixty-five other
guest rooms.  The guest rooms on this floor could be accessed via a long
corridor set out in an L-shaped design.  Two large windows with clear glass
panels and coffee-brown curtains, to the south of the landing, look out to
the old brick buildings of Elysian Fields Avenue as well as the faint lights
down the road.

Rowdy with cheerful bantering and noise coming from the bar, Azul's a
place for authentic Cuban and Asian cuisine, as indicated on the colourful
menu.  The bar instead is a short counter where four to five people could
sit comfortably on tall bar stools of gleaming red.  The rest of the
restaurant is decorated in dark, rich colors, similar to the hotel's decor. 
The flooring is dark brown parquet, upon which tables of black painted wood,
each seating four to six people on similar coloured chairs, are arranged,
with rustic settings placed upon them.  Apart from the bar where local
offerings and exotic mixtures are served, together with lager and beer,
customers could lounge around near a mock fireplace with clean white pillars
where a couple of ebony leather couches are placed.  Vintage chandeliers
with caramel-tinted blown glass bulbs hang down from the ceiling above the
tables while bronze fixtures decorate the rest of the walls.

and chairs of the Kitchen's interior.  The walls are painted a rustic
dove-grey, with large murals attached to empty spots, adding dashes of
blocky colour to the restaurant, autographed photographs of important
customers and Italian knick-knacks are displayed with pride on wooden
ledges.  Tall jars of golden olive oil sit on each table, together with salt
and pepper shakers.  The service counter is made up of clear plastic squares
fitted on top of each other, the old fashioned brick oven where many a
traditional crisp-crust pizza is baked, stands behind the counter, tended by
the chef for the evening.  The smell of cheese and tomato is redolent in the
air, together with cheerful, relaxed conversation and loud laughter, as
common in most French Quarter restaurants.

`nThe `BSt`bar`nlight`B E`bxpress`n Pub (`wAvg. NPCs: 10`n)~
Sleek and silvery, the Starlight Express pub consists of one long bar
counter, the top of which is a smooth creamy deep brown, and a immense
offering of various liquors, wines and a top class selection of beers and
ales from barrel-pulls in the front, snuggled between stainless steel
worktops covered with cocktail mixers, fruit juices and the long black
running tubes of soda-splashers.  Big glass cups for delightful mixes of
long island teas or tequila sunrises stand in stacks of fours and fives,
gleaming and ready.  Tall stools topped with leather cushions of matte gray
line up against the counters for the clientale of this pub, mostly youths
and university students.  Apart from the bar counter, tiny metal tables
jostle for space on the tiled ground, chairs of all sorts of shapes and
sizes, some cushioned, some hardbacked, tucked into them.  The walls are
filled with contemporary art and photographs, some donations from the local
university's art college.  A large sign behind the cash register indicates
that university students will be getting discounts for alcohol purchases. 
Paper stars sprayed with silver paint and dotted with glow-in-the-dark
stickers hang on the ceiling of the pub, swaying to the cool gusts of
air-conditioning sweeping in from the vents above.  House music take
precedence for most evenings, apart from Saturdays where a small stage is
set up and a local student band sing for the night.

The main dining room of Galatoire's is mirrored around with the best
silvered glass an establishment can offer.  Alabaster columns with Doric
fittings and archways of finest marble create a romantic atmosphere.  The
top half of the walls are covered with dark green velveteen, patterned with
golden fleur-de-lis, while below the separation bar of caramel-brown wood,
polished panels of rich veneered oak are found.  Round tables seating
anywhere from four to eight are captured in finest linen, porcelain and
silver cutlery, while along the walls, small tables for seating couples are
found.  Soft lighting is provided by Roman-bowl chandeliers off the ceiling.
Servers in sharp tuxedos weave around tables, serving the restaurant's famed
dishes, and glides silently back to and fro from the kitchens.  An arched
portal offers entrance into a quiet passageway west to the private dining
rooms.  Towards the back, a winding staircase with a darkened stairwell
allows guests to move to the second floor of the establishment.

An amazing ensemble of alcohols and liquors take precedence against a
huge mirrored wall, the bottles themselves resting on thin glass shelves
supported by silvered rods.  The bar is modeled after an antique 19th
century design despite the shiny modern beer tabs behind and the sleek LCD
screen of the cashier's computer down the other end.  Two bartenders take
helm behind the long, oiled oak counter, expertly mixing any drink or
cocktail requested by the seated customers.  The stools at the bar are
smooth wood, fitted with burnished copper, numbering about fifteen and
placed at a comfortable space from each other.  Burgundy-red velveteen
covers the walls of the bar and in a spacious corner a small stage is set up
for jazz piano performances.  Apart from the counter, two to three tall bar
tables are set up, providing places to gather around while guests wait for a
place in the dining rooms.  Tinted brown glass windows enables a view of the
evening queue forming up outside for dinner or drinks at Galatoire's.

#GT#ghe Second Floor, #GG#galatoire's #e(#gAvg NPCs#e:#g25#e)#n~
With windows looking out over the lighted stretch of Prytania Street, the
second floor of this renowned Creole restaurant sports a different design
compared to the vintage historical style of the main dining room.  Wine red
is the mainstay color; rendered upon the walls and in deeper shades as
curtains and drapes across the windows.  Fluted tulip-glass lamps create a
soft glow of amber across this dining room and all the tables with
comfortable polished teak chairs, are laid out in the same elegant manner as
the restaurant's tradition decrees.  Guests partake in the restaurant's
famed Grand Goute, souffle potatoes and many Creole specialties amidst
endless glasses of Blanc and Bordeaux.  Bronze-framed paintings depicting
New Orleans in the 1800s hang on the walls of the room, adding a touch of
nostalgia to the atmosphere.  The same winding staircase cast in shadows
lead back down into the lower floor.

#GA#g Private Corridor, #GG#galatoire's#n~
Fluted tulip-glass lamps light the stretch of passageway that adjoins the
main dining room and the kitchens of the establishment.  Along this stretch,
closed doors lead into private dining or party rooms, reserved for the elite
and high-flying crowds.  Servers slip past quietly, armed with freshly made
dishes or bringing away plates of finished meals, never interfering with the
movement of the guests in and out of the passageway either.  Further in a
secluded corner, the washroom sign for the ladies and gents can be seen,
hidden behind an artful floral arrangement.

#GA#g Private Dining Room, #GG#galatoire's#n~
Totally encased in elegant dark green with golden fleur-de-lis papering
upon the walls, with an oval table in the middle and twelve stylish teak
chairs all around, the setting of this private dining room closely resembles
a reflective mirage of Arthurian legend.  A low arrangement of pale pink
lilies and canna leaves is always in dominance upon the dining table's
surface.  A carafe-trolley placed in one corner contains cutlery, plates and
glasses for serving while a personal wine cabinet is apparent next to it, a
select choice of various vintages for the guests of that evening.  A
velveteen-covered partition appears to separate this room from another,
behind it being a closed door leading to the next chamber.  In one corner, a
pair of plush velvet chairs with accompanying ottomans forms a secluded
lounge with a widescreen LCD TV and various media devices accompanying them.

#GA#g Quiet Passageway#n~
Plain glass lamps light this stretch of passageway, the flooring carpeted
with dull dove-grey synthetic fur.  The walls are unpapered, painted however
in a dark green that seems to absorb much of the light coming from the
lamps.  The passageway appears long and straight, apparently moving down or
up a slope with the end coming to a short flight of stairs which end in a
sizeable antechamber before another pair of doors.

Resembling a hotel's guest lobby, this room is softly lit and strewn
about, are black leather couches together with a few single armchairs, all
upholstered in dark sanguine colors.  The floor is a black and golden-brown
harlequin pattern of clean ceramic tiles.  Printed media of fashionable
intents, financial interests or the latest mortal news are stacked up on a
centurion-cabinet flanked by two pots of velvety white orchids.  The walls
are an interesting mixture of wallpaper and velveteen coverings, marked over
in a gradation of fleur-de-lis in varying degrees of greens and emeralds.  A
door stands on either side of the chamber, leading to other rooms within the
underground labyrinth.

The Northern District - Dimmet (The Hedge)~
Buildings stretch up into the skyline of the northern district of Dimmet
at odd angles.  Each one bears a crooked chimney that bellows smoke out into
the hedge air.  As with the rest of Dimmet, this part of the city seems
constantly in a state of twilight closest to dusk.  There is a almost
claustrophobic feeling about the streets that wind their way through the
buildings - no broad thoroughfares act as highways to allow more than one or
two people to walk abreast in the streets.  The cobblestones are a mosaic of
sandstone ranging in color from the traditional yellow sand through various
browns, grays and even rusty red colors.  Lanterns line the streets that
glitter in the soft darkness.
#n
Much of this area is dedicated to housing.  No shops line the corners,
neither are there any vendors or carts that sell various goods or sundries. 
The buildings are made up of black, red, purple and yellow shades.  The
colors of the buildings do well in causing the cobblestones to stand out
even further.  The lanterns that illuminate the district seem to be free
hanging, allowing for them to swing lightly in any breeze that could travel
through the streets.

#GT#ghe Elysium Chamber#n~
Heightened cornices and the placement of lighting effects in the
rectangular Elysium chamber appear to create a spacious effect on the
otherwise average-sized room.  The similar black and golden-brown harlequin
design is found on the ceramic flooring; while strewn about in casual
comfort, are modern suede-covered couches seating three or four together
with low tables, and for introverts, singular armchairs and tall bar-stools
in elegant hardwood are provided.  A video projection screen together with
its own electronic devices is installed at one end of the chamber.  The
walls are papered in a vintage sepia tone; playing off the deep shiny black
of a grand Seller Konzert piano placed at a prominent corner.  Paintings
decorate the walls, mostly pieces of contemporary art with the Big Easy's
architecture and people as their themes.  Amidst the strategic placement of
furniture, a rather worn antique armchair with a unique sangria tint to its
velvet upholstering is placed slightly away from the groupings, two to three
other chairs in white cushioning flanking it.

Southern District - Dimmet (The Hedge)~
Much of this area is dedicated to permanent structures that are built in
an old cottage style that are stacked together in rows.  This is a veritable
hob city, with a great deal of strange creatures that ramble through the
streets and hang around the different buildings.  The majority of the
residents appear humanoid, if not a little distorted.  There is a great deal
of commotion and the cacophony of industry coming from the east.  Carts roll
through the narrow streets in that direction.
#n
The rise of a hill stretches westward.  As the hill arches upwards, steps
are cut into it to make it easier to ascend.  At the top of the hill is a
large manor house that looks out over the rest of the city.  North of this
district sits a larger collection of houses with roads and alleys that twist
and wind around them.  All the major roads within this district are lined
with hanging lamps that buzz softly with light in the eternal dusk of
Dimmet.

Goblin Market - Dimmet (The Hedge)~
Colorful, riotous and garish, this part of Dimmet is sectioned away from
the more staid and stoic areas of the city compound.  The Goblin Market has
been, is and will forever be a part of the city proper, despite the warning
signs that are posted on the streets that lead towards the Market.  The
cobblestones immediately change from the sandstone cobblestones of the
streets of Dimmet to a more blood red color.  Dusk continues to eternally
fall over the Goblin Market, but each lantern causes the stones to glimmer
brightly underfoot.
#n
Within the Goblin Market proper are twisting alleys built into a
wheel-shape with each alley acting as a spoke that allows for merchants to
set up their stalls and wares.  All manner of things are sold here and it
seems that nothing at all is sacred.  There are goblin merchants teaching
contracts, others selling tokens, some selling trifles and goblin fruits,
and even others that are selling slaves. For no reason at all a shallow 
hilltop of hard-packed earth coated in soft grass fills up one of the alleys,
and a round door made of wood panels opens with a brass knob at its very
center; Painted onto the door of #pYesteryears #nis what appears to be a
sprig of purple grapes.
#n
A sign has been posted front and center in the opening path leading into
the market listing the rules of the Goblin Marketplace.  A symbol has been
painted beneath it, along with the words "Neutral Ground". Any number of
Hedge denizens can be seen here, rumor says even the Gentry.

The alley is dark, light hardly managing to penetrate the shadows. 
Underfoot are puddles of what one would assume to be water, although the
faint stench that rises up indicates it could be something else.  The brick
walls of the buildings boast a few doors, all of them locked from the
inside, blocking passage of anyone trying to enter.

#oA Loading and Unloading Bay#n~
Rolling metal shutters keep the unloading and loading bay closed when not
in use and the concrete-layered parking bay is sufficient for at least two
large transportation vans to park side by side in it.  An elevated level of
concrete creates an easy mode of removing or loading goods into the back of
the parked vans, bands of yellow painted for safety on the gray stone ground
itself.  A wide green door bolted along its perimeter exits into the storage
area of the building where the restaurant is housed in.  Workers use a
second security exit set next to the rolling shutters whenever the main
shutter doors are closed.

Darkthorn Hill - Dimmet (The Hedge)~
At the top of stone stairs set into a tall hill that overlooks the town,
there is a large manor with a fountain and statue in front of it depicting a
nude woman made entirely of smooth alabaster.  Within the fountain are
collections of gemstones that have been worked into the stone base.  The
waters are pushed by jets of air that come in from small holes in the lip of
the fountain to prevent stagnation.  Small colorful fish swim in the water,
and tiny lily pads float along its surface with even smaller frogs that jump
and dive beneath the waters.
#n
The manor house is sprawling, taking up the majority of the hill and
stretching up almost five stories.  It appears to be made out of a mixture
of ivory, stone, alabaster and white-washed wood all cobbled together in a
strange colonial fashion.  At the front of the house stands a massive door
surrounded by two ivory buttresses with large, slightly opaque windows
facing out of them.
#n
There is a gazebo that rests near the edge of the hill by the stairs that
lead back down into the town.  Pounded into the ground next to the gazebo is
a sign that reads, "Darkthorn Hill," in block capital letters.  There is a
relative lack of greenery and growth on the hill, with the ground mostly
composed of barren, black rocks.

#GS#gtorage Rooms, Galatoire's#n~
The clinical white walls of this bright-lit storage room of the renowned
restaurant reflect off a multitude of large sturdy shelves and storage
containers, filled with the world's best ingredients.  Industrial level
coolers line one end of the room, packed with meats and seafood imported or
fished from local waters.  Bottles of exotic oils and sauces line many of
the shelves, along with boxes of dried ingredients and canned produce. 
Fresh vegetables and fruits in their hundreds, from the best grades of
apples and oranges, to special varieties of mangoes and pineapples are found
packed into boxes into controlled-temperature coolers.  A set of doors lead
into the restaurant's kitchens, where each ingredient is turned into a
delectable gastronomic delight.

Darkthorn Road - Dimmet (The Hedge)~
Dusk reigns eternal over the city of Dimmet.  Powerful magics thrum
throughout the city walls, warding away the sight of the Gentry and the dark
hobs that patrol the highways throughout the surrounding hedge.  The mosaic
of various sandstone cobblestone of the road spread out into a large
courtyard that has large stone buildings that house the guards and support
staff that protect and support the city.
#n
Armored guards can be seen walking from the barracks to man the walls of
the city or walking down the many small side roads to various other support
buildings.  Towards the north the courtyard flows into a road that leads
further into the city while to the west the gates stand open under the
watchful eye of the Dimmet city guard.

A bustle of activity surmounts in the grand kitchens of Galatoire's as
the chefs busy themselves with all performances of cookery, plating and
serving the latest creations of the season.  Cook-tops of stainless steel,
together with modern grilling and baking facilities aid in the production of
many episodes of a gourmet's fantasy - mostly the restaurant's famed Creole
specials.  The smell of cooking food and raw ingredients is heavy in the
air; along with the massive symphony of knives upon boards, spoons against
copper pans and the familiar French expletive or a shout of triumph as
dishes are completed and sent out to expectant and hungry guests in the
dining rooms.

Crossroad of Thorns (The Hedge)~
The courtyard facilitates the meeting of four roads, one made from blood
red stone, another a mosaic of sandstone, while another is made of blue and
silver stone that leads both to the north and south.  Each road meets at a
wide square made entirely of flat black stone.  In the center of the square
stands a simple fountain made of ancient gray stones that are weathered by
time and the elements.  The water within the fountain is a deep purple color
that flows down into a deep basin from the mouths of strange fish like
statues.
#n
The silver and blue cobbled road continues northwards towards the sound
of gentle water.  To the east the sandstone road leads to the far off
horizon where a large manor house is visible stretching towards the sky
behind tall walls that surround the city beneath the manor on the hill.  A
sign hangs beside the road leading to the east, in crude handwriting, the
word "Dimmet" has been etched upon the sign.  From the wooden crossbeam, two
large talons hang on chains, balancing the sign on its pole.
#n
Weeping willow trees with leaves made of silver grow along the sides of
the silver and blue cobbled road as it continues on to the south.  The road
made of blood red bricks winds off towards the west up to a distant hilltop
surrounded in the same large thorny bushes that make up the surrounding
Hedge.

#eMaspero's Exchange and Cafe #w(#eAvg NPCs#w: #e15#w)#n~
Dark exposed beams comprise a large portion of Maspero's ceiling,
yellowish antique lamps forming the bulk of illumination in this tavern-like
establishment.  Shadows creep about most of the corners though individual
tables do have their own tiny lamps, with a fine layer of dust on them. 
There are no table clothes to break up the dark atmosphere, and the
furnishings appear spartan, with bare wooden chairs.  The bar runs along the
wall on the right hand side of the interior, facing the establishment's
entrance from Decatur Street.  A massive wine rack looms behind the bar, the
bottoms of gleaming wine bottles barely visible in the shadows.  The regular
tables for customers are arranged in rows, giving the impression of long
tables in the great hall of a medieval castle.  The kitchen's entrance is
towards the other end of the bar.  Full of smoke, noisy and redolent with
the smell of lager and fine pastrami sandwiches, the local-inn feeling in
this place is a great hit with the locals and tourists alike despite its
off-color history as a slave exchange.

Willow Lake (The Hedge)~
A place of bizarre serenity is here beneath the boughs of willow trees
that leave droplets of silver to rest upon the waters.  Large stones jut out
of the earth at semi-symmetrical locations surrounding the lakeshore.  The
lake appears to be deep and while the water is still, a slight ripple now
and again is a tell-tale sign of a current coming from beneath the surface
of the water.  To the south and leading up to just before the shoreline is a
road made out of silver and blue stones.  The stones stop ten feet away from
the lake, replaced by red, muddy soil.  Water lilies and cattail plants grow
just within the lake's waters, reaching up to about three feet tall.

Merriment enroaches the entire landscape of fun, frivolity and fantastic
structures of steel and lights arching over the sprawling environment of a
modern amusement park.  Tall metal turrets, painted white and encased in a
brilliance of colourful lights, spiral to the sky, large banners with the
emblem of Six Flags marked upon them.  Far in the distance, the huge spoked
circumference of a gigantic ferris wheel looms, its metal structure
decorated with glittering bulbs.  The ticketing booths are wrought with
people even at this time of the night, queues forming at the white-topped
tent-like minihouses as mortals await excitedly to tumble into a hedonistic
realm of candy and craziness before them.  The twining loops and
death-defying turns of various roller coasters scatter about the park,
awaiting the hordes that would be terrified or exhilarated by them.  Beyond
the ticketing booths, the twinkling music of a huge carousel, complete with
gaily painted plastic horses and a pumpkin-styled carriage could be seen. 
The atmosphere is thick with the smells of popcorn, candy-floss and people
of all ages and races.  Surrounding the amusement park, the dark shadows of
the New Orleans swampground press in, perhaps hungry for the radiance
emitting from the park itself.

Darkthorn Highway (The Hedge)~
The road here narrows considerably as it leads southward, increasing by
nearly double its size to the north.  Willow trees with silver leaves line
the pathway leading to the north and south, with the Hedge topography
becoming more alien.  Twisted, curved plants made out of different organic
and inorganic substances mingled together in a nightmarish hodge-podge.  A
sign has been pounded into the earth at a smaller pathway leading to the
west.  The sign has hands pointing west and north, indicating a crossroads
to the north and "unreadable letters" along the path to the west.
#n
Cobblestones made out of silver and blue stones march along the highway
north and south, with the road leading west made out of consistent stone
blocks that are evenly cut and well-crafted.  The foliage of the Hedge thins
considerably along the stone pathway leading westward with a noticeable lack
of vegetation - as though someone or something had beaten back the Hedge. 
Rubble made of large stones blocks the path to the west.

The interstate is left behind as traffic winds down a looping curve
towards a large road heading northwards.  Parts of the famed New Orleans
swampground can be seen by the side of this wide road, in the further
distance, greenery and forests.  Trucks and SUVs form the bulk of vehicles
travelling up and down the length of the road.  The road heads northwards,
to a grand merriment of twining roller-coaster tracks, a huge ferris-wheel
dominating the dark skyline, its lights blinking in excitement and a fog of
hilarity over the entire escapade of the `pNew Orleans Six Flags`n amusement
park.  By the side, amidst bushes and low shrubs, huge billboards depicting
advertisements can be seen; from fast food to gentlemen's clubs, casinos and
the latest real estate offers.

The modern world is closer here as the Hedge gives way to accouterments
like cement, windows and glass.  An archway on the southern part of the road
seems to lead through to the real world.  This highway is paved in blood red
stones, cobbled down and held fast to make a road wide enough for two
carriages to travel beside one another along its length.  At the edges of
the roadway are curving plants and taller thorny bushes with long reaching
vines.  The vines seem to lean towards travelers of the roadway, but the
thorn-covered vines never cross onto the stones.  The road goes onward
towards the east.

people in them, seated, and with faces pressed outwards to take in the
grandness of the amusement park's other attractions.  A arrangement of
candy-striped tents contain various themed games; whilst the prizes of giant
plushes or plastic dolls sit on shelves waiting to be won.  Shouts and
whoops of exhilaration and excitement thrive through-out the night,
punctuated by the frequent screams and cries from the roller-coasters and
other theme rides.  The atmosphere is thick with the smells of popcorn,

The road here is lined with cobblestones that are a mosaic of sandstone
ranging in color from traditional yellow sand through various browns, grays
and even rusty red colors.  Around the road are walls of the Hedge with
their thorns thick and ruddy.  A small stream runs alongside the road and
into the hedge, the water a light purple color.  To the east is a large
stone wall the thrums with the powerful magic of the wards protecting it and
the city behind it.  An open gate leads into the city of Dimmet while to the
west the road cuts through the hedge leading towards the Crossroads of
Thorns.

`rRoyal Street on the Gallier House Carriageway (Avg. NPCs: 5)`n~
Gun-metal blue iron bars feast upwards into curled sharpness, forming the
main gates into the carriageway of Gallier House.  Festooned with
intricately fashioned metal plates on the outer portions, the gates are
closed usually to unauthorized traffic.  A smaller side-gate, suffice for
one person to walk through appears to be always open near to the right of
the main gates.  The salmon-pink brick paving that floors the entire
carriage way is bare and empty save for the sprigs of wild grass growing
in-between interlocking spaces.  The walls that flank the right of the brick
road are twice-white washed, covering signs of wear and weathering after the
House's restoration process was completed.  Tall cypresses are planted by
the walls, providing shade upon shade in these humid southern evenings.  On
the left, traditional French louvers and doors panel the side of the House,
dressed in a mid-Victorian style.  Soft dim lights and classical music peter
out from the windows from the bar and restaurant inside, forming shapeless
pools of yellow on the brick carriageway.  The road continues eastwards, lit
by antique black iron lamps on tall wooden poles.

and empty save for the sprigs of wild grass growing in-between the
interlocking spaces.  The walls that flank the right of the brick road are
twice-white washed, covering signs of wear and weathering after the House's
restoration process was completed.  Tall cypresses are planted by the walls,
providing shade upon shade in these humid southern evenings.  On the left,
traditional French louvers and doors panel the side of the House, dressed in
a mid-Victorian style.  Soft dim lights and classical music peter out from
the windows from the bar and restaurant inside, forming shapeless pools of
yellow on the brick carriageway.  The road continues eastwards, lit by
antique black iron lamps on tall wooden poles, opening up towards the
shadowed structures of a marble fountain and a stone courtyard.

`rRoyal Street curves around the Gallier House courtyard (Avg. NPCs: 7)`n~
Simplicity is the key to this garden of round marble fountains in which
tiny delicate spurts of water erupt merrily into pools filled with silently
swimming fish.  The lawn exhales a rich scent of wet grass and rich soil,
itself sectioned into careful, geometric parts in which various species of
star aster and daisies are grown.  Surrounding the courtyard are rows of
traditional French louver set into the House's brick walls which are painted
a creamy milk-white.  The corridors around the perimeter are bordered with a
waist-level white lattice railing upon which tiny wooden boxes filled with
sweet irises are affixed.  Stone benches ring the courtyard for anyone wish
a brief respite in this tiny patch of wistful nature which is buffeted by
manmade structures.  The carriageway's brick pavement can be seen to the
west while a shadow-enscapulated hallway to the north allows entry back into
the House's rooms.

#eA Quiet Hallway, Gallier House#n ~
A strip of dark blue carpet is laid in the middle of the tiled floor of
the hallway, stretching from door to door and turning at right angles into
other parts of the House.  The walls are papered in a wallpaper of gold and
ivory strips with scalloped borders of cornflower blue, resembling a
landscape of waving wheat and fair white clouds.  The doorframe of each and
every door is painted a bright white while the doors themselves are of
finest wood rendered a rich honey brown.  An alabaster cornice decorates the
perimeter of the ceiling where round-bowled lamps hang down to provide a
homely yellowish glow.  Paintings of 18th century New Orleans are hung on
the walls, framed with faux gold.  Mostly reproductions, some of these art
pieces include old photographs as well as pencil sketches, apart from the
usual oils and water colors.  The hallway continues north and turns right to
the east into a smaller passage.

#eThe Dining Room, Gallier House#n ~
The dining room is modeled after a Victorian setting for a high class
dinner, complete with a long table set for twelve.  Porcelain plates edged
in gold and the finest wine glasses and water goblets sit in classy
precedence on fine water-brushed linen while tasseled cushions tied to
wooden chairs in the style of the era completes the set.  The silverware
appears to be authentic antiques from the period; quite noted on the
information board catered to visitors, and as well on leaflets and brochures
placed in attached plastic slots.  Behind are wooden cabinets with more
porcelain dinnerware on display while the windows with white French louvers,
are draped in cornflower blue curtains.  A few mannequins are placed about
the set, dressed in Victorian style; and looking almost like a scene from a
Jane Austen novel.  A barrier of faux velvet roping is set around the
display to prevent visitors from entering, allowing a comfortable passage
for them to stand and observe or pass through.

#eThe Foyer and Hall, Gallier House#n ~
Modern amenities are built into the classic layout of the old world
architecture this foyer used to possess, in aid of the visitor groups and
other organizations that use the services of Gallier House.  A wooden
counter in hues of rich brown is set up together with a computer system and
record files for the reservation of group tours and other paperwork. 
Photographs of New Orleans in black and white, from the 18th century
plantations to the hype of the 19th century and also of various landmarks
and celebrations are hung on the papered walls.  An ornate shelf carries a
selection of brochures and leaflets about the House itself as well as all
other important tourist destinations in New Orleans.  A seating area is set
aside for visitors to rest and a vending machine for coffee and soda is
placed nearby.  Palm-frond fans with attached lights descend from the
ceiling above, and light ivory drapes cover the windows.  The sounds of
traffic can be faintly heard from the western doors that lead out into the
small verandah and steps leading to the junction of Esplanade and Royal.

#eThe Parlor, Gallier House#n ~
Palm-frond fans swirl slowly, creating an island-like mood, in this chic
and classy lounge and dining place within Gallier House.  Chairs draped in
lightweight muslin are placed together with small tables for casual dining,
each one lit with a small antique electric lamp.  A long bar stretches from
one end to the other, glass cabinets and shelves filled with an enormous
array of liquors from various sources around the world.  The seating portion
of the bar is set on an open-air verandah; a few steps eastwards would lead
guests into a small private garden, lit with sparkling fairy lights.  The
menu is distinctively Creole and French, indicated by the large painted
signboards hanging about the walls, denoting the establishment's fame for
oysters and fish.  Guests come in all forms, mostly dressed in smart casual
wear, jackets and gowns are not necessary indeed.  Classical jazz plays in
the background, forming a soothing accompaniment to the buzz of conversation
and the sounds of cutlery in the foreground.

#eA Gas-Lit Antechamber, Gallier House#n~
A strip of dark blue carpet is laid in the middle of the tiled floor of
the hallway to soften approaches if any.  The walls are papered in a
wallpaper of gold and ivory strips with scalloped borders of cornflower
blue, resembling a landscape of waving wheat and fair white clouds.  The
doorframe of each and every door is painted a bright white while the doors
themselves are of finest wood rendered a rich honey brown.  An alabaster
cornice decorates the perimeter of the ceiling where round-bowled lamps hang
down to provide a homely yellowish glow.  Paintings of 18th century New
Orleans are hung on the walls, framed with faux gold.  Affixed to the walls
are Victorian-styled lamps, with round-blown amber glass fittings, the lamps
darkened as if they are only adornments on these walls.  The doors
surrounding the antechamber are all closed and locked, each one of them
possessing a locking device with a metal plate for biometric fingerprinting
and a numerical keypad in black plastic.

#GA#g Long #GP#gassageway#n~
Sturdy stone steps lead down from the locked door of the warmly-lit
antechamber above, straight down into a quiet passageway lit by
Victorian-styled lamps, the whole passage wrapped in a warm yellow glow. 
The walls are painted a deep burgundy, in some parts appearing as a shade of
sanguine wine.  The art work of preference here appears to be of oils and
depicting various bayous and forested landscapes of the South.  At the end
of the passageway, a set of large doors come into view; the familiar locking
device appearing by the side of the doors.  Two guards dressed in fine,
black suits and pants stand by the doors, poised and armed, quite ready
check upon any guest entering into the main chamber.

#GT#ghe #GE#glysium Chamber#n~
Expansive like an auditorium but set underground, the Elysium below
Gallier House is decorated extensively in the style befitting the age that
the architect himself was born into.  The walls are entirely covered in a
crepe-patterned wheat-white paper, absorbing the soft glowing aureate
illumination overflowing from bulbous frosted glass lamps descending from
overhead.  Settees, covered in plush velvet or smooth creamy leather, are
arranged in comfortable fashion around upon large oriental rugs.  Carafes
and wine decanters, with their own glasses are at an easy reach on silver
trolleys around the chamber; the harshness of metal and glass softened by
the dizzying array of sequined, feathered Mardi Gras masks and headdresses
festooned about the walls.  Single armchairs are available for those
introverts and spartan wooden chairs or bar-stools for those allergic to
velvet and leather.  Amidst the strategic placement of furniture, a rather
worn antique armchair with a unique sangria tint to its velvet upholstering
is placed slightly away from the groupings, two to three other chairs in
white cushioning flanking it.

#GA#g Spacious, Barricaded Office#n ~
Walls painted, instead of papered, in deep green surround a familiar
setting of a mahogany desk together with a comfortable leather chair and two
smaller armchairs facing it.  A sleek computer system, with its LCD screen
encased in white plastic and frosted laminations sits on the left corner of
the desk coupled together with a concise compilation of stationery and
writing papers.  A statue of a rearing horse in fine polished jet stands
upon a large scheduler set flat on the desktop.  Completely windowless, the
office is lit by a few frost-glass lamps plying a sterile, white light. 
Detailed maps of New Orleans and Baton Rouge are framed up in wood,
separated in their various districts and parishes to be set on the walls.  A
compact library of various genres of books, ranging from history books about
New Orleans, travelogues and tourist guides about the City, and also every
singular piece of literature ever written of the Big Easy can be found here;
magazines, media collectibles and the like.  The door into the office
appears as thick as one would find of a nuclear bomb shelter.  A locking
device is also attached to heighten the security of this office.

#GT#ghe Oval Room#n ~
Not withstanding a mockery of the White House's own Oval Room, is this
construction of gorgeous gold painted walls and faux windows covered in long
daffodil-colored drapery.  The entire floor is precisely covered with a
carpet of giant proportions, patterned in the style of Tudor royalty. 
Elegant furniture in the form of smooth silk-covered couches,
delicate-legged glass-topped tables and chairs upholstered in a checked red
and gold fabric is placed about the room.  A crystal chandelier tops the
decadency of this room off, descending from a ceiling armed in scalloped
white plaster cornices.  Sepia-tinted photography in dull bronze frames are
placed about the walls, while the largest photograph, a panoramic view of
the 19th Century Mississippi Boardwalk spans the mantelpiece above an clean
and unused fireplace.

`eA half-collapsed confessional booth`n~
The priests' side of this confessional has collapsed entirely, the once
fine redwood panelling leaning heaviling against the center divider.  The
other side is mostly intact, with a cushioned, slightly molding seat and a
mess of broken rosary beads collected about a depression in the flooring. 
The remains of a few burned out white waxen candles lie scattered through
the ruins.  The roof is left open, rotted and fallen, and the nighttime sky
is visible above.

`eCollapsing halls behind the altar`n~
A long, narrow hallway composed of old greying stone stretches high
overhead, collapsed in places to reveal the vast black dome of sky overhead.
The stones that fell from the ceiling lie haphazardly across the ground,
which is laden with foliage blown in over centuries of hurricanes.  A few
puddles of grimey water fill holes in the ground, depressions in the earth
and stone weathered into fruitition over time.  Draping vines and moss grow
on the remains of the walls, and the odor of moist soil, rock and greenery
is well present.  At the east end of the hall lies a darkened archway, and
beyond a tight stairwell.  To the west is a door with fresh, clean padlocks,
leading out into the old cathedral.

`eA crumbling spiral staircase`n~
Blackened grey stone winds up toward the old belltower, surrounded on all
sides by the encroaching threat of jasmine, spanish moss and heavy vines.  A
few solidly locked, dungeon-style doors lie here and there, the rooms beyond
them collapsed.  The stairs themselves are composed of finely carved rock,
patches of the engravings that once covered their borders still visible
behind weathering and caked clay.  At the very top of the staircase is an
archway identical to the one at the bottom, save for the intricate
engravings that encircle it in full, depicting apple blossoms and branches
with a rugged crucifix at the pinnacle.

`eOld Belfry of Saint Sophia Cathedral`n~
Giving a clear view of the night sky is the peak of this ruined tower. 
Stone rises up to form a lip on all sides, providing something of a railing
for those who venture here, protecting against the winds as they whip up the
rough sides of the structure.  From here, a clear view of the entire French
Quarter can be had, and the only thing obstructing the rooftop is a circular
miniature of the main tower, inside which the four, majestically large iron
bells still suspend in ornate arches; the glinting color of a massive,
circular stained glass window sends little flecks of color across the
rooftop, obscured for the most part by the bells.  One can enter the
belltower by a small stairwell.  Reinforced wooden doors that look newer
than the majority of the other arcitecture lead west.  Blowing in spiraled
gusts about the belfry is an everpresent layer of organic debris, and the
heavy odor of the jasmine that threatens at all times to overcome the
structure crawls through the stones.

`wA Steel-Enforced Security Room `C(`wHoly Ground`C:`w 1`C)`n~
This space is rather claustrophobic, perhaps ten by ten in size, and
lined on two walls with nothing but black and white display monitors showing
various scenes both inside the cathedral and outside it.  A steel control
panel can be flipped open to reveal a set of multiple colored buttons and
switches, all of which presumably are used in accordance with the security
equipment present here.  The floor is solid hardwood and the ceiling
remarkably high.  The only furniture in this room is a large, swiveling
black leather chair and a stout footstool with a leather cushion.  Two
shotguns, a tranquilizer gun, sturdy steel manacles, cuffs and a basin of
sharp wooden stakes are arranged for easy access on one wall.

`wA Clean Stairwell `C(`wHoly Ground`C:`w 1`C)`n~
Painstakingly sterile linoleum stairs lead underground, lined on either
side of the walkway with theater bulbs - tiny, but bright enough to cast a
light prominant enough to navigate by.  At the top of the stairwell is a
series of electronic and manual locks upon a massive, thick steel door, a
numberpad backlit with cool blue, and a line of red light that slides up and
down, scanning everything and everyone that passes through for whatever
result they are engineered to divulge.  The door at the bottom of the stairs
is rather simple - wooden, unpolished, with a brass knob one might expect on
a bedroom in the suburbs.

`wChapter House `C(`wHoly Ground`C:`w 2`C)`n~
Solid steel walls seal this underground complex, holding the marshy earth
beyond easily at bay.  The floor is a unfinished, clean wood, covered in the
majority by dark red Indian rugs, woven especially tight for resilience. 
Large, squishy second-hand couches are placed in formation at the center of
the area, giving the impression of a very home-like space.  A fireplace sits
on one side of the couch circle, with a fairly massive burnished oak
entertainment center on the other.  At the center lies a simple maple coffee
table with a few moisture rings, old magazines and newspapers cast across
it's surface.  The sleek matte silver remote controls for the television,
DVD player, VCR, stereo and other audio and video equipment lie on the
coffee table as well, piled in a small, green wicker basket.  More private
sitting areas are arranged here and there, composed of a few squashy knit
cushion chairs with bookshelves stocked with books both old and new, or
small end-tables beside them.  High above a ceiling fan lazily pushes air
about the room, and the cozy brick fireplace is always filled with
smoldering logs, casting sedating warmth throughout.  Against the northern
wall, beside the opening to a hallway, lies the half-enclosed stairwell
leading up into the security room.  Sterile steel double-doors lead west
into the hospital wing, occasionally giving way to a nurse or two.  A single
door opens southward, usually left partially open, and a white-walled hall
leads east into the libraries.  An entire portion of the room is dedicated
to a series of cement-walled cells, sealed off with both electronic and
manual locks and ridiculously thick, solid steel interlocking bars.

`rThe Hilton`n~
Gleaming marble in veined maroon and pale buttercream tiles the floor of
this expansive, almost overly lavish lobby with aesthetic geometric designs,
interrupted only by a perfectly square, massive indian rug that sits at the
epicenter beneath a marble fountain depicting a reclined mermaid holding a
shell in both hands that overflows into the basin, which is broad and
approximately two feet deep, filled with a noteworthy community of ghostly
koi.  The walls are an elegant hue of eggshell white, the ceilings moulded
and the lighting provided by a series of lovely chandeliers in highly
polished brass and sterling silver, the little electric lights shaded and
distorted to resemble real candlelight with uncanny accuracy.  An ATM
machine for Bank of America is mounted in the wall beside the large
elevator, which is modern to the extreme in function, while remaining old
fashioned and almost Victorian in design; large black buttons line the
interior panel, labelled with serif fonts in gold, and the gauge to display
which floor the elevator is on from the outside is the traditional curling
arrow along an arc of gold numerals.  The front desk lies within it's own
alcove, opposite the elevator and entrance to the stairwell.  To the west is
the large, weight-sensing glass doors that slide open automatically when an
individual approaches to admit them to the pool, and to the east lies the
lounge.

`rIndoor Pool at The Hilton`n~
An Olympic sized swimming pool with clear turquiose water is the obvious
center of this enclosed area, it's smooth interior aglow with backdrop
lighting, the biggest focus of all such illumination upon the lavish Hilton
logo at the bottom center of the pool itself.  The flooring around the pool
is of infinitely smoothed wood panelling, polished with a lustrous dark
cherry stain that matches the edgings around decorative arches in the
neutral cream white ceiling.  Live palms in large wooden planters are placed
methodically around the entire circumference of the pool, and identical
pool-side devans of smooth wood slats with waterproof cushions are arranged
in clusters.  There are several warning signs affixed to the entrance
requiring swimmers first to shower, disallowing running and banning children
under twelve from entering the deep end without parental supervision.  A
lifeguard is on duty through the daylight hours, but after nine the pool is
left unattended save for by Hilton staff who take orders for cocktails,
champagne or more casual alcoholic beverages.

bubble-crystal ash tray and a small lamp with a deep red shade.  Stairwells
wind up either side of the expansive, richly carpeted lounge area, leading
couples or individuals seeking privacy to snug alcoves with individual
seating arrangements and small balconies overlooking the lounge, enclosed
with glass guardrails.  An attached bar with a blood red vase of perfect
white roses and a finely polished cherry stained top is open twenty four
hours, with a waiter on hand to take and carry orders.

proper key card for the room.  Down the hall to the far right is the
emergency exit, marked by a lit arrow, with the elevator directly opposite.

`rRoom 201 at The Riverwalk Hilton`n~
Neutral, plush beige carpeting spans from one clean white wall to the
next, complimented by the starkly ebony sliding drapes on the full length
bay window that overlooks the boardwalk and Mississippi.  A standing lamp
with a simple eggshell white shade is placed beside a comfortable, though
nonremarkable, buttercream yellow chair with a small tea table before it. 
The bathrooms are immaculately clean, with a combined light and fan, granite
countertops and full tile through the bath and shower combination.  Twin
queen beds with chestnut wood headboards, an inoffensive floral print
comforter, complimenting bedskirt and pillow shams sit to the same wall,
with a nightstand between them containing a digital alarm clock, the remote
control to the mounted television, an offwhite plastic phone, the Bible, an
earthy-brown glass lamp and a local phone book.

`PVictoria`p'`Ps Secret`n~
An opaque, pink glass overhang emblazoned with the frosted logo of the
store attaches to the outside of this mall outlet.  The doors lie open, and
a wash of warmth and feminine floral perfume lingers from the doorway on. 
Elegant displays with ivory and fuschia gauze are arranged everywhere;
little white tables laden with lace slips hold perfectly folded silk panties
in the latest styles, satin and silk brassierres hang from decorative
hangers with little pink bows, lining the walls in groups organized by
style.  Various pieces of lingerie, from slinky little nightgowns to the
overtly seductive babydoll chemises and sheer lace thongs adorn tables, are
arranged in displays and dangle attractively from hangers.  Beneath a large,
backlit logo in burnished gold at the back of the store lies the counter, a
curving, white surface with an electronic cash register atop it.

`rHot Topic`n~
Ornate faux-stone gargoles and spiraling curls of iron open to reveal a
dark hole of a shop, filled with high racks of fishnet tops, band t-shirts
and hoodies, most in shades of black, grey and red.  The floor is a coarse
charcoal colored carpet, absorbing the weight of footfalls sufficiently
enough to make them all but soundless.  Loud, thrashing music echoes out
from speakers mounted near the ceiling in several places, and an entire wall
is dedicated to mounted t-shirts displaying various band names, subculture
phrases and retro cartoon or anime characters.  Cubby-holes beneath the
displayed shirts hold the actual merchandise.  Turning racks of spiked
chrome jewelry, chokers, collars and belts are placed here and there, with a
glass-enclosed display with jewelry for the majority of piercings.  The
staff is colorful and well suited to the surroundings, and on the counter
sits a bin filled with buttons.  At the back of the store, behind the
shelving filled with magazines, goth comics and other cult-fan merchandise,
is an enclosure sealed off by a curtain of heavy scarlet velvet, used as a
fitting room.

`BThe Gap`n~
Sleek beige carpeting and pristine white walls offset the navy blue Gap
logo present on every tag on every piece of preppy, stylish clothing. 
Polished silver-chrome racks hold button-up shirts for both men and women,
slim cut blue jeans in the popular faded and beaten style.  Dresses in
various pastels, every cut of pants one could envision, woolen peacoats and
v-necked cardigan sweaters appear to be the current ongoing theme, with
matching belts, sandals and hair or jewelry accessories organized into
adjoining displays.  At the very center of the store is the main display,
offering whatever item has been the most advertised as of late.  The
lighting is soft and white, offering a clean feel to the store.  The counter
is at the very rear of the place, and on the adjacent wall are rows of
fitting rooms with swinging white doors.

`GJ`ya`Gmba Ju`yi`Gce`n~
An unceasing grinding noise echoes out loud within this claustrophobically 
small outlet, coming from the dozen blenders working at all times to fill 
specially insulated styrofoam cups with slush.  The smell of fruit is a 
heavy veil, from the distinctly tropical odor of crushed melons and 
passionfruits to homegrown scents like berry and citrus.  The walls are 
painted in gaudy, almost blindingly cheerful colors - bright yellow and 
neon green splash out, patterned with airbrushed fruit and random 
splotches in orange and red.  The floor is checkered red and white tile. 
Pale honey toned wooden chairs line circular glass-topped tables in
quartets, and shelving along the wall beside the cashier holds Jamba
merchandise, from t-shirts to lipgloss and sponsored local musicians'
albums.  A plexi-glass wall before the blenders and cutting boards allows
the customer to watch their drink being created.

`ySunglass Hut`n~
Open displays and endless racks offer every possible style of sunglasses,
organized by brand or prescription.  A thousand lenses peer out at the
onlooker in various shades of amber, grey, red or black.  The floor is a
simple, clean grey pavement that lends an outdoorsy feel, and the lighting
is flourescent and white.  Brand names like Rayban and Dolce and Gabbana are
illuminated by backlighting, their brass letters burnished and
faux-antiqued.  The cash register is set in a sort of island arrangement,
surrounded by polished, light teak countertop.

Creaking, molded wooden floor panels with a thin layer of old maroon
carpeting provide noissome announcement to anything, be it person, animal or
a stiff breeze, passing through here.  Dozens of thick old doors in
unfinished, rough wood line the damp, cracking plaster walls, yellowed from
their original white paint to a drab yellow.  At best, one out of ten of the
overhead electrical fixtures actually work, providing a limited, dim light. 
Against the wall beside the entrance door lies a buzzer intercom system,
transferring more static than voices.

against one wall, leading up toward a pair of double-doors up close to the

`eA spacious loft atop a dilapidated old building`n~
The loft is a very large space, though all in all, it is not truly a very
desirable location to live; the walls are exposed brick and wooden struts,
it is high up and as a result, probably drafty, and of course, they are very
rarely maintained in such areas.  However, this loft has been turned
habitable.  A large circular window allows a very open view of Canal Street
below, lined by thick, heavy maroon velvet curtains which hug against the
wall snugly to obscure any light.  One end of the room is devoted to
sleeping; that being a large iron-wrought four poster bed, lined with
similar curtains that block the window, and next to the bed is a small table
with a circular mirror.  The rest of the room is defined as a kitchen-living
space; the kitchen being an old, deep sink and simple gas stove, while the
living space is a cozy combination of victorian-style furniture and a large
rug.  A black guitar and amp sit next to the couch, both connected to the
electricity mains.  An iron staircase spirals up to the ceiling and out onto
the roof while another door leads to what is likely a bathroom.

`eRooftop of a dilapidated old building`n~
The only other access to the rooftop besides the loft beneath it is the
single, rather decrepit ladder descending to the ever-distinct metal fire
escape, though judging by their state they are not often used at all.  The
place is as one would expect of such a building; the stone is old and
weatherworn, edging around the small enclosure like a mockery of a castle. 
Little is actually up on this particular building, save for a large
television antennae and several broken slates.  The large black-tiled roof
looms along-side of it threateningly, that being the lid of the majority of
the building, and judging by the many loose slates it is in need of some
degree of repair.  A decent view of both Canal and Toulouse Street can be
attained by standing here, and even a shot of North rampart, if one were to
clamber onto the less welcoming, human-friendly portion of the roof.

`eApartment H2 in a dilapidated old building`n~
Heavy oak beams have been left open to show the angle of the roof in this
one room living space, a single, large scaled arched window the only view to
the outside, over-looking an underworld view of New Orleans; a narrow, black
alleyway lies eight stories down, obscured by distance alone.  Curtains of
dark crimson silk appoint the window, in stark contrast to the simple, aged
wood walls, left completely unfinished out of either laziness or lack of
funds.  An oversized leather chest sits at the foot of the four post bed
with an antiquated pile of books upon it, a bundle of what would appear to
be sage sticks tied with twine positioned above the topmost text.  The bed
itself is set with a pair of delicate handcuffs at the head, and infinitely
soft, black satin sheets - the kind of fabric used to line caskets, and
blatantly so.  Several oak candle holders bedecked with thick scarlet
candles are ringed about the room, two perched near the sofa, which boasts a
simple oak frame inlaid with rosewood, and thick cushions of black leather. 
Rough wooden floors disappear under a dark rug of knotted-rya, more a
comfort piece than actual floor covering, used to draw together the seating
area.  Two leather wooden swoop armed chairs nestle in under an glass
pendant light tinted deep red, with a stout oak table at the center.  A
pull-down wooden trap door in the wall leads to the east, onto the fire
escape.

Cramped in-between two buildings with space sufficient for a line of cars
to park themselves parallel next to one of the walls, the alley is filled
with dark green garbage containers for refuse and throw-aways.  Wet puddles
stretch along the tarmac, the potholes filling up with dingy water.  Broken
furniture and paper boxes, wet and soaked by rain are left here.  Sometimes,
these brick walls would be brightened by a new layer of grafitti in blood
red or chalk white spray.  Iron railed stairs and landings are affixed to
the squat walls, next to tiny ventilation windows.

#pArcadian Books & Prints#n~
The atmosphere of the Arcadian is one of warmth and welcome, the first
thing greeting one's senses upon entering an intriguing mingling of fresh
lavender and harvest spices, as though a pumpkin pie were cooling on an
unseen windowsill.  The lighting is dim enough to promote a sense of
intimacy, while still illuminating the various goods and sundries to be
found on countless shelves and within wood and glass display cases.  Just to
the right inside the door, an invitingly plush sofa in burgundy velvet
stands flanked by two overstuffed chairs, offering cozy seating for the
patrons of the shop.  Built into every wall are seemingly endless shelves,
providing homes for everything from books on voodoun and the occult, the
tarot, crystals, dream interpretation and so on, to a wide selection of
handmade candles in a vast array of scents.  Glass vials and small clay pots
bear products ranging from salves advertised to promote healing, a more
youthful appearance, to oils - both perfumed and essential.  Crystals of
various sizes and types can be found nearby a display case cradling an
impressive selection of jewelry, many pieces hand-crafted and one of a kind.
Less prominent though still carefully - almost lovingly - displayed here and
there about the shop are various works of art, both paintings and statuary. 
Dried herbs, resins and flowers of nearly every kind can be found on yet
more shelves near the back counter, which houses such miscellaneous things
as a few athames and bolines, a bone rune stone set, a cauldron and a small
stuffed teddy bear.  Often seen prowling or lounging about is a black
domestic cat with a single patch of white fur at its chest.  Its luminous
green eyes seem alert and attentive, the creature friendly, for the most
part.

#RHarvelle's (Avg. NPCs: 16)#n~
Within the yellow and red rundown building is a sight to be seen.  Its
bright in here lit with candles and gaslights and florescent bulbs, it seems
whatever the owner could get their hands on.  A neon sign of a cartoon
crawfish blinks Open!  And pinches it with a little claw.  The walls are a
brilliant emerald, decorated by murals done in several different styles of
the local swamp land.  All around are sets of tables and chairs.  Some of
them might have been purchased in ultra modern boutiques and others pulled
from the local landfill, all mashed together by the Doctor Frankenstein of
interior decorators.  One counter runs along the east wall, pulled straight
from the 1950s complete with black glittering stools and a soda fountain,
behind the relic is a like of mirrors creating the illusion of a much
greater space.  Opposite that is a little island with a turn table set upon
it, there is a huge binder beside it filled with a list of all the albums
and the songs they contain.  However before someone might decide to play DJ,
a small note is taped to the front of the binder.  It reads 'Do not change
the record - ask the person behind the counter.  ' A large chalk board hangs
from the ceiling ten feet from the main entrance.  It boasts the old
favorites of traditional New Orleans flavor as well as what beverages might
be constructed by the staff.

Upon leaving the noise of the Caf its self one is greeted by the smell of
barbecue and citrus mosquito candles.  The patio stretches about twenty feet
in any given direction, home to picnic tables topped with small candles in
Tiki god shaped holders.  In fact above the back door a large Tiki god is
watching the whole outdoor spectacle.  The yard rolls out much farther then
the patio with properly groomed trees wrapped in multi colored Christmas
lights.  The view of the swamp land out past the interstate is breathtaking
but being this close to the murky waters have brought more then one scaly
visitor to the place.

`RApartment`n~
A small section of the cafe's upstairs storage area has been converted
into a sleeping quarters.  The walls within the small apartment are painted
in purple and green, several posters decorating them.  A little closet has
been built into one wall, with a pair of needlessly fancy French doors
barring the clothes from the rest of the room.  The largest feature of the
room is an old row boat, the bottom sawed off and turned in to a bed frame. 
There is a little television set on the floor by the boat-bed, it's rabbit
ears set at an odd angle.  A huge bay window covered by curtains fashioned
from a decade of old t shirts, it leads to a little ramshackle balcony. 
From the tiny space ten feet above the actual patio quite a bit can be seen,
the continual barbecue below, the rolling swamp land in the distance, and
the stars.

refuse and the occasional rat corpse.  Wet puddles stretch along the
cracking asphault, potholes filled ankle-deep with dingy water.  Broken
furniture and paper boxes, wet and soaked by rain are left here.  The living
record of decades of graffiti cover the walls from top to bottom.  To the
east lies a dimly lit opening, leading one onto Toulouse Street.  Westward
is the rear side of a massive old apartment complex.

#y=#oReception Foyer#y=#n #y[#oJuan Soliz and Associates#y]#n~
The reception foyer of Juan Soliz and Associates appears relatively clean
and unassuming.  The walls are plastered with a pale cream stucco, a cheap
substitute of more expensive wallpaper and energy-saving flourescent lamps
stud the top of the false ceiling, stoppered with square chipboards and thin
metal-strips.  Pale blue linoleum line the floor from one end of the wall to
the other, squeaky clean and smelling thickly of cleaning bleach.  On the
walls, credentials hang behind wiped glass and wooden frames, belying the
expertise of the small handful of lawyers in this establishment, mostly
dealing with immigration services and citizenship law.  Another credential
denotes the bone fide practices of the legal service here; and a large
green-lined noticeboard explains various proceedings and law in Spanish,
Vietnamese and Chinese.  Batches of stiff blue plastic chairs lean against
the walls away from the noticeboard and wall of credentials, while a
magazine rack nearby offers a selection of property and employment magazines
for brief distraction.  A rounded receptionist counter secures the entrance
into the establishment's main offices, obviously entry would be granted upon
an appointed with any lawyer.  A small computer beeps lethargically behind
the counter, managed by a tiny female receptionist with large bifocals.

#y=#oAn Open Office Space#y= [#oJuan Soliz and Associates#y]#n~
An open office seperated by tight aisles and even squashier cubicles fill
out the entire renovated hall after the main lobby.  At regular intervals,
chrome-plated fans with wooden fronds swirl lazily above head, secured to
the chalk-white plaster of the false ceiling above.  Windows appear to be
sealed up, and blinds placed over them while chill air-conditioning simpers
out from a few vents overhead, inbetween the decorative fans.  Three to four
office staff, mainly females, work at filling up forms and other
administrative work.  Computers beep occasionally from these desks, and the
sound of muted phonecalls in foreign languages is a mainstay in the
atmosphere of this space.  The ground is still covered with the same squeaky
clean blue linoleum and the walls lined with cream stucco.  Wooden doors
line both sides of the walls, the knobs a little worn and the bottomside of
the doors themselves look slightly soaked from damp.  Plastic name-plates
are screwed on the doors, labelling each one with the name of the lawyer
occupying it.  Another name-plate on the door east indicates the room as a
common office for meeting clientale.  A small passage-way leads off to an
elevator landing where an elevator serves the lower level of the apartment
building.

The inside of the office is furnished with functional furniture,
sacrificing style for durability.  A wooden oval table is placed in the
middle of the office, ringed by six comfortable cushioned roller-chairs. 
The table is devoid of items or decorations.  Metal cabinets of a pale limey
green stand along the west wall, each one firmly locked.  One black-painted
bookshelf nearby is filled with files and ringbinders for mostly easy access
to standard immigration law information.  Grimy windows thickly covered with
Venetian blinds and followed by plastic curtains keep the room sheltered
from outside interference.  Air-conditioning wafts out in chill gasps
through a few vents overhead, segregated between wired yellowish lights, at
times making a soft rumbling noise.

Cream Venetian blinds cover all the windows of this office, the windows
themselves sealed with white mortar.  Air-conditioning wafts out from the
slit vents overhead, making an odd rumbling noise softly now and then,
keeping the room chill.  An oval dark green carpet is strewn over the pale
blue linoleum used to line the floor of the office, upon which a large
wooden desk is placed, complete with a standard set of stationery, papers
and immigration law books.  A large office chair of stretched leather sits
behind this desk, while two holstered sofa chairs are placed in front of it,
ensuring everything appears comfortable and easy.  Two bookshelves of
polished wood and steel lie against one of the walls, stacked with a variety
of books and files.  Snuggled in a corner is a steel trolley, carafes of
wine sitting on it with a small assortment of heavy liquors, together with
six drinking glasses and some folded napkins.  Yellowish lamps sit inbetween
two wooden-fronded decorative fans, copper cords dangling from their centers
to be pulled and activated.

One elevator serves the two levels of the apartment building.  The signal

second floor all the way down to the ground floor.  The inside of the
elevator is panelled a dull beige, the walls separated by aluminium
stripping.  A ventilator fan runs noisily inside, tossing dust into the
interior as soon as the door is closed.  Squeaking sounds accompany each
ascension or descent, along with a heart-thudding jerk each time the
elevator comes to the designated floor.

#y=#oA Document Vault#y=#n [#oJuan Soliz and Associates#y]#n~
Patternless gray concrete walls line the four sides of the law office's
document vault, though between the shelves of old wood and steel, locked
doors with biometric scanners are seen.  Plastic files of a variety of
sombre colors line these shelves, filled with confidential information of
clients and other privileged and important information accruing to the
office's modus operandi itself.  A locker-styled cabinet spreads itself over
one length of the wall, made of gleaming stainless steel.  Dial locks are
upon all of these lockers, each one turned to a random number.  Various
documents and collaterals are placed within the lockers themselves.  Another
low shelf holds a selection of printed paper dictionaries in different
languages to plain English, and a shiny laptop sits right on-top of it wired
and ready to be used.  A large table of heavy maplewood with a few cushioned
chairs are placed in the middle of the vault.  Soft yellow lamps are used to
light the interior of the vault, though there is also a switch for bright
flourscent lights if required.  Air-conditioning of a comfortable chill
factor simpers into the vault, occasionally giving off a certain hiss or
rumble in the quietness of this underground chamber.

#GA#gn #GA#grchaic #GL#gibrary#n~
A stone-walled underground chamber spreads over a wide room, the size of
a standard assembly hall.  The ground is paved with tiles of sandstone,
black mortar lined inbetween the squares.  The top of the chamber is
artfully made to resemble a royal burial chamber of a pyramid's interior,
with a gabled ceiling of red sandstone, at where the two slabs meet to form
a perfect triangle, three copper lamps hang downwards, keeping the lighting
muted and the atmosphere a semi-yellowish state.  A square archways built
with shaped stone blocks provides entry and exit from this chamber, a
biometric scanner set into the archaic design of the archway.  Electric
braziers emit light fumes from the corners of the chamber, enveloping the
interior occasionally in wafts of frankincense and sandalwood, fragrances
used for embalming.  Metal chairs painted gold with red cushions, and
crafted like the thrones of pharaohs long past are placed in twin sets at
various sections of the library.  Tall bookshelves pierce through the
yellowish glamour, the shelves mostly thick mahogany wood, made to last and
varnished into a deep bloody sheen.  A variety of texts, many of which
appearing fragile and aged, sit on these shelves, their contents greatly
beloved of those whom are allowed the benefit of this ancient library.

#GT#ghe #GG#great #GH#gall of the #GT#gemple of #GS#get#n~
An immense chamber of sandstone walls towers upwards to a gabled ceiling
of colored sandstone, mostly in shades of dark bloodred to pinkish quartz. 
Hieroglyphs etch deeply into these walls, forming recitations and praises to
the will of Set and his Desires.  Apart from the hieroglyphs, the walls are
decorated with painted scenes of esoteric lore, of Osiris' betrayal and
Set's return to his children.  Effigies of snakes coupled with runic
designs, in which sublimal messages of loyalty and sin are inclusive, caress
other parts of the walls not encompassed with religious intontations.  In
the middle of the chamber, rows of hard wood pews fill most of the space,
each pew carved with designs of twisting snakes and protective hieroglyphs. 
Electric braziers emit heady fumes from the corners of the temple's prayer
hall, enveloping the interior occasionally in wafts of frankincense and
sandalwood.  A large altar is set up before the foremost of the pews, right
in the front of the prayer hall; marble painted with gold and upon which
various sacraments dedicated to Set are placed.  Live snakes twin the steps
and the carved pillars, twisting in languid symphony with the scents from
the braziers, the creatures kept forever in a state of dedicated hynoptic
dreaminess.

#GSeven-Eleven on Esplanade#n~
Bright glaring flourescent lights engulf the tiny convenience store in a
flood of clinical white, shining off the metal bars of the shelves clustered
together.  Bags of chips, fried snacks and cookies cramp in bunches on one
shelf while the next aisle holds a variety of junk -- from chocolates, to
gobstoppers and bags of jellybeans.  A section of old-looking machines
dispensing soft ice creams and sodas sit in the middle of the store, the
renowned slurpee machine placed at eye-catchingly to the front, the gaudy
neon-colored paper signs stuck onto the machine's churning front denotes the
signature flavors for the day.  Cups of ramen, ready-to-eat sandwiches and a
glass case of donuts linger on a bearably clean counter facing the cashier's
register while alongside of it two huge coolers hug the wall, filled to the
brim with canned sodas, plastic bottles of colorful liquids and an array of
cheap to mildy-expensive beers and alcohols.  The floor appears moped daily
though between the tiles, years of grime and dirt from shoppers' shoes have
already concreted inside.  Trays of candy on cheap sale together with
bottles of water and boxes of condoms, hunch together on the already
squashed cashier's counter, while boxes of cigarettes, and a selection of
some hard liquor sit on the shelf behind the cashier

`wHospital Wing `C(`wHoly Ground`C:`w 2`C)`n~
Tiled with meticulously clean white linoleum, the hospital wing is fairly
massive, containing rows of hospital beds with life support machines upon
rolling tables, cabinets filled with medical supplies and endless caches of
high-tech machinery.  The stone of the western wall has been removed and
replaced with concrete fixed with three solid steel doors, each crafted with
a thin, heavily barred window, often covered by a curtain pulled across to
afford the occupants privacy.  Nurses, priests and nuns bustle through at
all hours of the night, and it isn't uncommon to find a surgery or othersuch
operation going on, making the sign reading 'Quiet is requested at all
times' a necessity rather than a preference.

A comfortable bed with retractable rails is set with the head centered
against the wall opposite the door.  A stainless steel scrub sink and
bottles of antibacterial hand cleanser are on one side of the room, and an
overhead light attached to an adjustable arm can be swung to any placement
above the bed.  A padded stool that can be rolled across the clean linoleum
flooring is beside the bed, and a large locked teak cabinet holds gowns,
drapes and sterile, individually sealed instruments.  A heavy plastic bin is
installed to one wall, marked with the bright yellow biohazard symbol.

`wThe Armoury`C (`wHoly Ground`C:`w 2`C)`n~
This is a well-equipped armoury with racks and shelves lining every inch
of each wall, save only for space for the northern door.  Despite the dense
content all items are arranged in an organized manner; sets of kevlar body
armour and bullet-proof vests are placed onto armless fabric dummies, an
ample selection of weapons are arranged all upon one wall, firearms from
rifles to revolvers on another.  Blades of all the common shapes, and some
rather exotic, are placed into wooden racks, and knives in firm, black
leather sheaths ready for the taking hang in a straight row from the
underside of a shelf, upon which are several heavy boxes of ammunition and
meticulously sharpened stakes.  A crate of grenades, flash bombs and tear
gas caps are arranged away from the rest.  The door that leads north is
hardly fortified, without anything of a lock, though a sign-in and out book
for the equipment here does indeed make clear that the cell keeps track of
it.  The floor is covered with a dark red Indian rug, much like the one in
the main room, if a touch smaller, and a massive crucifix mounted upon a
carved oaken head is set at the pinnicle of the room high above the tallest
shelf.

`rRoom 2B`n~
Two four poster beds in dark, burnished pine sit on opposite sides of
this fair sized room, each bearing double memory-foam mattresses and a
thick, goose-down coverlet folded at the foot.  Heavy, hand-quilted blankets
and sheets of soft, clean cotton have been laden over each bed, both of which
have a polished wooden push stool with two steps to allow for ease in
climbing on.  A thick linen curtain in solid black can be pulled to a close
about the bed, forming a partial canopy to allow for complete privacy while
asleep.  Several cabinets are arranged on one wall, crafted of dark mahogany
with light engravings along the borders of the drawers, likely used for
stowing the personal effects of those who stay here.  The floor is covered
wholly in thick, plush, dark blue carpeting, and the roof is lower than in
the rest of the underground complex, with a very modern, elegant white
ceiling fan attached, providing light to the room from a frosted glass dome
at the center.  A clean kitchenette stocked with modern appliances and a
running sink fills a corner of the room, and another is closed off by thick,
concealing wooden screens, containing a faux-ivory bathtub, shower cubicle,
mirror and toilet.  Similar screens block off portions dedicated for
changing one's clothing in privacy.  A tea table is set in a comfortable
nook, with a pair of chairs on either side, both elegantly crafted of pine
and set with velvet cushions.

A cramped, irritatingly small, metal sewer, those who would be stupid
enough to try to navigate it on foot would find they need to crouch down, or
even crawl on hands in knees, through the six inches of thick, disgusting
water.  Several pipes spill into this smaller vein, often bathing the
unlucky trespassers in a new wave of vomit-inducing liquids and liquid-like
solids.  All the sewage is frigid at all times of the day and year, though
it may not be entirely wise to wish for the opposite.  As if printed on the

The sewer waters slosh heavily against the concrete walls, the immense
weight of the shoulder-deep sewage resulting in disturbingly high waves,
granting waders a mouth-and-nose high surprised, should they attempt to walk
through.  Bits of metal littering the floor suggest an attempt to create a
catwalk or some sort of transit method at one time.  Everything else one
would feel floating in, on, or below the water is hardly as humdrum; one is
sure to come across their share of used condoms, discarded hypodermic
needles, and good old human fecal matter.

#wA Bedroom#n~
#wIt would seem that the farther one moves into this building, the worse
that it becomes, at least concerning things such cleanliness, order, and
oxygen.  If there is a floor to this room, it would be quite hard to tell,
lest you were to dig down through the piles of cast-off clothing, abandoned
papers, and forgotten literature.  This room is quite laden with
decorations, from the lava lamps that have been scattered here and there in
sporadic placing, to the neon lights that grace the walls, though the most
attractive display would have to be the giant dragon that sits in the corner
of the bedroom, his frame crafted of steel-belted tubing, and his sights
burning with a red light that radiates from the installed LED fixtures. 
Extending from the maw of the beast is another hose, this one clear and
rubber, which connects to a gas-mask, giving it the look of a device made
for nothing less than total asphyxiation.  Against the east wall is a desk
with a more than comfortable looking chair of black leather, and occupied by
the presence of a beautiful and orgasmic looking tri-screen computer setup,
complete with anything that a true nerd could ever need or want.  Gracing
the northern wall is a chaotic looking waterbed, un-made and with the sheets
just cast about into a random pile, mixed with even more discarded clothing,
and just next to the bed is a door that leads into what would appear to be a
bathroom.  If someone were to look up in this decadent haven of youth and
dirt, they might take notice of the ceiling, and how it has been covered
with copious amounts of CDs, of which all have been turned down so that the
reflective sides can be seen.  #n

#oThe Sewers#n~
The scents of human waste are most prevalent here, as are the sounds only
one lurking in the sewers would hear: pained homeless, vomiting drunks. 
This sewer line is quite close to the surface, indeed.  At some points, it
would even be possible to peer through a curbside duct at the intoxicated
stumbling ankles of passersby.  The waters are in full flow, and one must
cling to the catwalk or risk slipping and tumbling into the rancid water; if
only it were not held by tack-welded rebar and the remnants of I-beams long
corroded.  Every so often, '#CDauphin#n' is painted on the wall in
industrial, stenciled paint.  Smaller sewer veins run north.

The sewer's passage has become impossible after this point.  The catwalk
has broken off, collapsed, and took much of the sewer walls with it,
creating an impassible barricade of concrete and jagged debris, fit only for
the leaking of water in small streams.  Anyone attempting to move east will
need to find a new route.

This sewer line is quite close to the surface, indeed.  At some points, it
would even be possible to peer through a curbside duct at the intoxicated
stumbling ankles of passersby.  The waters are in full flow, and one must
cling to the catwalk or risk slipping and tumbling into the rancid water; if
only it were not held by tack-welded rebar and the remnants of I-beams long
corroded.  Every so often, '#CBourbon#n' is painted on the wall in
industrial, stenciled paint.

The sewer waters slosh heavily against the concrete walls, the immense
weight of the shoulder-deep sewage resulting in disturbingly high waves,
granting waders a mouth-and-nose high surprised, should they attempt to walk
through.  Bits of metal littering the floor suggest an attempt to create a
catwalk or some sort of transit method at one time.  Everything else one
would feel floating in, on, or below the water is hardly as humdrum; one is
sure to come across their share of used condoms, discarded hypodermic
needles, and good old human fecal matter.

A cramped, irritatingly small, metal sewer, those who would be stupid
enough to try to navigate it on foot would find they need to crouch down, or
even crawl on hands in knees, through the six inches of thick, disgusting
water.  Several pipes spill into this smaller vein, often bathing the
unlucky trespassers in a new wave of vomit-inducing liquids and liquid-like
solids.  All the sewage is frigid at all times of the day and year, though
it may not be entirely wise to wish for the opposite.  As if printed on the
inside of the metal ceiling for just such an occasion, the word
'#eChartres#n' appears every hundred or so paces.

The water looks unusually clear in this particular sewer, no doubt due to
the seepage into the sewer from the river directly south.  However, clear
water is not always a good thing, and the #owaste#n and #etrash#n left to
the imagination beneath opaque, brown water is all too visible, perhaps
making this pipe line the worst to swim in.  Luckily, a single catwalk
bolted to the northern wall, rusted and shaky as it is, seems to still be
able to hold enough weight.  Every so often, '#CDecatur#n' is painted on the
wall in industrial, stenciled paint.  The sewer bends north, as well.

southward, strangely in the direction of the river.

A strange drainage pipe of constantly fluctuating size, this sewage vein
serves as the final collection.  The amount of water in this portion of the
system is entirely dependent on the particular width of the pipe in any

path to walk on and sporadic changes in the water, assorted debris and

The depth of the water in begins deep and steeply bends upward, resulting
in almost oceanic, shore-like waves of disgusting sewer water.  The concrete
slope is, itself, slippery with unidentified sewer slime, and one will oft
need to grab hold of the drier walls to attempt to pull themselves up and
into the shallow sewer way to the west.  Much like a shore, garbage flowing
into the sewer to the east will 'wash up' onto the concrete and lay to dry
and rot, intensifying the wretched scent.

#bThe Spawning Pool#n~
#eThe walking path extends not but two people wide, clinging vigorously
to the inside wall.  A pool of water, beginning shallow enough, but quickly
increasing in depth until imperceptible, overtakes the rest of the room. 
The thin row of luminescent mushrooms managing to survive whatever lurks in
the water grow where the ceiling and walls meet, attracting small groups of
large moths and lighting enough of the water for the wise to be afraid; its
waters are a grotesque combination of #bblacks#e, #obrowns#e, and #rreds#e,
thicker than water and disturbingly akin to any number of visceral fluids
and the Mississippi mud.  Rats, enormous and entirely hideous, routinely
slip into the water and clamber out, insects of unidentifiable origin hum
and buzz as they fly and walk over the water.  The way the water moves
suggest something bigger than rats and insects lurking beneath the surface.

#eA staircase of immaculately crafted steps descends further into the
ground, each stair wide enough for two to walk side-by-side.  The
luminescent mushrooms grow on the outer edges of the stairs, both guiding
the way, and creating a magnificent visual effect.  A torrent of water
redirected from filling the spawning pool falls downward in the center of
the staircase's spiral, the mushrooms casting dim light through the eerie
#gg#cr#gee#cn#e water.  The stairs, perhaps more slippery than any other
floor in this level, have been adorned with a rusted guardrail, its support
bars crudely made flowers, almost beautiful in their simplicity.  #n

The tunnel bends northward and eastward, bits of the walkways crumbling
into the rancid sewer waters.  Several surfaces of iron grating are inlaid
into the sewers to drain water somewhere else, but do not seem to be much
adjusting the flow or amount of water.  Someone has placed large planks of
wood across the water to suffice for the lack of proper walkways.  An iron,
grated door closes off what appears to be a collapsed tunnel.

#eA diesel generator, holed up in a wooden crate lined with random bits
of sound-reducing drywall, foam, and other paraphernalia sits in a corner,
salvaged bits of air duct catching the exhaust and delivering it into a
ceiling vent leading elsewhere, powers a trio of televisions.  They sit one
on top of the other, and each have a large, bent antenna made of coat
hangers and aluminum foil in fruitless attempts to improve the wretched
signal.  Luckily, the background static is usually enough to cover the
muffled rumble of the generator.  A pair of musty couches with torn
upholstery and exposed springs, inexplicably maneuvered through the sewers
and down the ladder, rest against opposite walls, perpendicular to the
television wall.  A similarly ragged rug splays on the floor.  Pegs hammered
into the walls hold items of Warren significance, the most prominent a very
large cellphone from the '80s, a trinket belonging to none other than
#oImmanis Arbiter#e.  Many pegs hang emptily, offering local Nosferatu hope
of one day leaving their mark.  #n

#eThe rusted ladder leads through the darkness into a small, brick cove,
softly, but brightly, lit with nothing less than a garden of #pluminescent
mushrooms.  #e This garden, however, is extraordinary not only in its flora,
but it extends to every surface of the room, the fungus adhering to the
bricks on the floor, walls, and ceiling, the fine sheen of water leaking
through the masonry both feeding the fungus and adding a rather pleasant
ambiance.  Every mushroom varies from the other in size and position,
ranging from a dime-sized heads parallel to the ground, to heads the size of
dinner plates; the stalks bending from the weight.  A path in the mushrooms
has been cleared to allow an unobstructed walk through the garden from the
ladder, the strange, sporadic rustling amongst the fungus perhaps a hint as
to why one cannot simply walk through them.  The path forks into dimly
illuminated walkways to the north and west.  #n

pours into it from above to leak into the north- and south-bound pipes.  The
walls are scarcely two feet apart, and will often require those passing
through to army-crawl through and be willing to immerse themselves in the
wretched liquid falling in endless downpour.

`pDecatur Street (Avg. NPCs: 44)`n~
Little more at it's origin than a series of offshoot streets, narrow
alleyways and layered, terraced Parisian balconies that line the faces of
the pink or pale yellow painted buildings, nothing that has been modernized
about the modern Decatur Street manages to detract from a historical, almost
theme-park-like air of antiquity.  The sidewalks are old, dark grey paved,
weaving beneath balconies and overhangs bordered by their simple pillars or
iron poles.  Potted greenery dangles in lines from the balconies, and air
conditioning units whir with life at all times of the night, blowing chilled
air into the flats.  Tall cypress trees nestle in between buildings and on
almost every street corner, riddled with draping Spanish Moss and
accompanied by the more occasional maple or oak.  The architecture is
antiquated to the extreme, and the street signs, vehicles parked beside the
sidewalks and othersuch modern touches contrast violently with the
historical feel, providing a distinct, charming anachronism.  Every few
yards a very old iron fire hydrant has been installed into the sidewalk,
rusted from top to bottom.  To the north, #eGargoyle's Clothing#n is almost
hidden just on the corner of the street.  The traffic in the street becomes
heavier in this area due to the tourists constantly trying to cross the
street.

Angeli's has been a local favorite amongst the night life for quite some
time now.  Their menu of pastas, burgers and vegetarians specialties, draws
in all walks of life.  Movies played upon the back walls offer up
entertainment during any opened hour.  Resting just out of the way of the
touristy area, Angeli's tends to be a locals only type of restaurant. 
Tables line the far way and front window section overlooking Decatur while
an "L" shaped bar brings in people that are just after a quick drink.

#gThe Library#n~
#eA small, claustrophobic room, the library is about eight paces square,
each wall carved into a stone bookcase, lined with wood, rubber, and
plastics to deter moisture.  Each shelf is filled to its potential with
books in myriad states of decay ranging.  Wire and wicker baskets hang via
chain from the ceiling and hold information less formal than books:
magazines, business cards, phonebooks, hastily xeroxed packets, newspapers,
and any other textual medium without a proper storage method.  The mutant
moths are very fond of this room, fluttering about the ancient paper and the
mold it spawns every hour of the night.  Texts too ruined to be useful are
deposited into a trash bin in which the moths most commonly feed and
reproduce.  #n

high ceiling, completely coated in the illuminating fungus.  A stage, little
more than pieces of scrap wood and metal hiked on cinderblocks, big enough
for any manner of soliloquy, is pressed against the furthest wall.  Rows of
seats ranging from rusted folding chairs to overturned trashcans sit in an
ironically organized fashion, seating about ten per row for three rows,
facing the stage.  The floor is kept devoid of mushrooms and the larger rats
for the sake of navigation.  The walls have been plastered with old
political campaign, movie, and concert posters, each faded and peeling from
the relentlessly wet walls.  The entrance path spills out well behind the
third and last row, continuing northward into another room.  #n

Stadium style seats flood the whole inner portion of the Super Dome.  The
higher the viewing area, the more standard the seat.  Upon the lower decks,
the chairs grow larger with more cushion.  However, no matter where one sits
within the stadium, the whole of the field is easily viewed.  Steep stairs
lead visitors up and down towards their seats, some of the stairs even lead
down to the field and press area.

field like anchors holding the whole stadium down.  Massive panels facing
each other from opposite ends, display the action on the field during any of

`wRuins of the Saenger Theatre Lobby`n~
Black and white tiles, once polished to a high sheen - now covered by a
thick layer of grime and debris - compose the flooring, and graceful slick
columns in the style of Italian architecture form a truly breathtaking area,
falling apart or not.  Beautiful pieces of Parisian and Italian art fill
recessed alcoves that have decorative, peeling wallpaper adorning their
arches.  A matching thick border of wallpaper in blue, aqua and golden hues
travels along the uppers edges of the wall.  Hanging lamps and a chandelier
with dusty bulbs from the Chateau de Pierrefonds, a sometime hideaway for
French royalty near Versailles, once offered ample lighting for patrons to
enjoy this antechamber to the main theatre, now providing little more than
an antiquated feel of disuse and history.  Dust and the wet scent of mold
hangs heavy in the air.

The Port of Call was established in 1963 as a steak house on the historic
Esplanade Avenue in the French Quarter.  The Port started as a quiet, small
neighborhood restaurant open only at night, and has grown into an extremely
popular destination for locals and tourists alike.  Today the Port of Call
is world famous for the burgers and steaks.  The awards are too many to
list.  Many thanks to the loyal customers who return again and again and
again.  Open seven days a week with an extremely casual environment, this
small burger joint is for family, tourists and locals alike.

#eThe inside of this small club is decorated in a dark and gothic decor. 
Bright colored lights pulse behind billowing sheets of dark purple cloth,
throwing undulating shadows and shards of light around the mirrored bar. 
Loud music mixes with the sound of dozens of voices straining to rise above
the ambient noise level in the club.  Several bartenders, dressed in leather
and chain, move at a fevered pace, serving everyone with their orders and
sarcastic comments.  There's a mirrored glass door set in the north wall,
and the dance floor extends westward from the bar.  Another door in the
eastern wall opens to a staircase leading up to the Mythique lounge.  The
southern wall is comprised mostly of doors, opened to the street.  #n

near the bar, spinning hardcore industrial beats.  Huge speakers have been
mounted to the wall near the DJ booth, and several plasma screens display
shifting patterns of purple and red light.  Haphazardly arranged around the
dancefloor are several couches upholstered in black, as well as a few chairs
and stools.#n

walls, covering most of the lights, giving the room a very sedate and dark
atmosphere.  A small bar along the east wall is staffed by a single person,
who is busily mixing drinks and serving beers to the patrons.  The southern
wall opens to a balcony overlooking the entrance of the Dervish and Decatur
street.  A staircase in the corner of the room leads back down to The

#rLafitte's Blacksmith Shop #e- #r(#eAve NPCs#r:#e10#r)#n~
Stepping up into the blacksmith's shop, it is a large room with several
tables and chairs scattered about a central fireplace which appears to be as
ancient as the building itself.  Unsure of the draw of the place, and with
it undoubtedly showing its age as one of the oldest surviving buildings in
New Orleans, any patron only need hang around after dark to discover the
ambience.  Lit with flickering candles and tea lights, the fireplace, the
rickety tables and chairs all lose significance as the patrons make up the
attraction of the bar with their boisterous talk, cozy meetings in corners
and requests to the elderly musician at the honky-tonk piano in the back. 
No electric lights, just the natural darkness of perhaps the hideout of a
couple of privateers makes this one of the most popular late-late night
hangouts in the French Quarter.

A curious place to enjoy nightlife and the outdoors at the same time,
this lovely garden has a bar of its own and trees with fairy lights strung
about the branches.  Bright neon beer signs adorn the outer wall of the
Blacksmith Shop.  People sit and enjoy the night and stare at the Lover's
Statue in the middle of the garden; Aphrodite clothed only in the waves of
her long hair, but with tan lanes added for posterity and humor.  A
television is mounted on the wall of the building, broadcasting whatever
sports game is going on.  The sounds of the city are muted here, and even
the buzz of the bar and tinkling of the piano drift out in bits and pieces.

`gClosed remains of Molly's at the Market (Avg. NPCs: 0)`n~
The nostalgic feel of nineteenth century signs, pictures and old celtic
paraphernalia still crowding the walls offers a muted welcome to this old
pub; the walls are thick and damp and everything is covered in a blanket of
dust, thinned where break-ins have resulted in footprints or othersuch
disturbances in the layer of tangible haze.  Hanging lamps with colorful
glass shades hang down over dusty, unused tables, and a vibrant Mardi Gras
mural covers an entire wall.  The high ceiling is fixed with numerous fans
with wide blades and flags.  Clover decor and unlit green neon signs
advertising various beers add to the idea of a once animated ambience.  The
long bar runs along the wall opposite the mural, and individual tables with
their chairs stacked atop them are along the other.  An old juke box lies at
the far end of the room, and broken casino games with their coin boxes
completedly ripped out are nestled about it.

Murals cover the brick walls of this smaller back room, depicting a
thousand faces from delicate senoritas from an age long past or Mardi Gras
Queens, rough gamblers and cowboys, all with a certain air of melancholy in
this damp, abandoned place.  Lattice-work now overgrown with real vines,
long-dead potted trees, comfortable padded benches and a line of empty
porcelain bowls labelled with various pet names offer this area, however
lonesome it lies now, echo of a homier enclosure than the front bar. 
Polaroid photo booths sit snug against one wall, their pull-across curtains
moth-eaten and their interiors caked with grime.

variety of masks, rattles, dolls, candles, jewelry, offerings, statues,
books, beads, tarot cards, oils and incense assaults the senses with bright
colors and lavish sights as well as smells.  The front display window is an
alcove with an altar built onto the ledge, containing t-shirts, voodoo dolls
and offerings around a statue of the Voodoo Queen, Marie Laveau.  Passing by
the crammed shelves and displays one spies many smaller statues of the
beloved Popess available for sale.  Gris-gris bags or wangas are stacked in
piles and bins, smelling strongly of sage.  A rack of brightly colored
chicken feet and other portable juju draws attention to the prayer cards
beside them.  Altars to Catholic Saints are as populous as those for Marie
Laveau; the blend of Catholicism and ancient voudon is seamless.

forms, pens, inks and a fingerprinting area are the first things that are
seen on a large counter area off to one side.  There is also a chair and a
computer camera set up for mug shots.  After booking, people are placed into

moat below and unseen things lurk just under the surface.  Figures moving in
and out of shadow await the doorman to announce permission to enter the
Dungeon and the world where a Turkish Prince once gave many a patron a
torturous existence.  Damp air only quickens the senses and lends to the
excitement and aire of danger as the creak of chains are heard and a deep
voice announces, "Enter."

figures mesh on the dance floor in the freedom of that age-old communication
of dance.  The array of people in all sorts of outfits, hairstyles and sects

#eMen's Library in the Dungeon #b- #e(#bAve NPCs#e:#b5#e)~
Well lighted all around, this red walled bathroom sports a long counter
with black porcelain sinks and gold trim.  Even the urinals along one wall
are black porcelain.  Spacious stalls allow for privacy and room enough to
change clothes if needed.  A relaxing waiting area with bookcase, table and
overstuffed chairs is near the entrance for a few moments get away from the
normal Dungeon scene.

#BN.O.P.D. Offices#n~
On either side of the walkway now, there are low walled cubicles fronting
private offices.  Computers, phones and a variety of filing cabinets, case
files, paperwork and forms can be seen on the desks indicating a very busy
place.  Each private office has a door and windows so the occupants can
glance out and see what is occurring in the work area or lower blinds for
privacy while in conference.

`BClub Hemlock`b;`B The Pit `b(`BAvg`b.`B NPCs`b:`B 159`b)`n~
`bA writhing mass of bodies envelops the soul that braves the pit of Club
Hemlock, and a violent assault of odors, from the lulling scent of marijuana
and cigarette smoke to the bitter tang of alcohol, reek of sweat, alcohol
and vomit.  The music is a deafeningly loud boom of either heavy metal or
old-style punk, with messy, fast-moving drum beats and pulsing, often
screaming lyrics.  The live band of the night stands sealed within a
chainlink cage at the very center of the thrashing pit, and flying bottles
arrange for a fair portion of broken glass across the hard cement floors,
filtered in with cigarette butts, joint roaches and othersuch paraphanalia. 
On every side of this massive, warehouse sized enclosure locking doors line
the walls, sound-proofed and padded heavily with thick black leather that
has been hammered into place with steel rivets.  To the east can be seen a
glimmer of faint, dark bluish light, leading out of the pit and back toward
the entrance. `n

`BClub Hemlock`b;`B Private Booth `b(`BAvg`b.`B NPCs`b:`B 1`b)`n~
`bPlush black suede furnishings are arranged feng shui about this private
room, sealed off from the main club by a leather padded, soundproofed door
with an electronic security check system; people passing in and out must
hold their card up to the scanner for the locking mechanisms to thud open. 
The walls are a solid, confining black, with an ebony wood chandelier
suspended from the ceiling lit with small, realistic candleflame-bulbs.  The
carpet is a thick, plush royal blue, absorbing the sound of any footfalls. 
A pair of french doors covered by immensely voluminous blue velvet curtains
with gold tassels leads onto a rusted fire escape.  `n

#eGargoyle's Clothing#n~
Dungeon doors open into a spacious corner shop that supplies both classic
gothic clothing and a place to hang out to the local French Quarter crowd. 
An dizzying supply of strapped, belted, beaded, studded and spiked clothing
is displayed on the walls and on racks through the center of the shop.  One
whole wall is dedicated to leather boots with anywhere from a two to twelve
inch heel, and from calf, knee, to thigh height.  Most of the clothing on
sale leans toward the darker side of the spectrum, boasting luxurious
blacks, sultry reds and dark purples.  There are some vibrant neons, but
those pieces are overwhelmed by the shadowy colors in surplus.  Bondage
skirts, lots of black leather, uniquely dark jewelry and other accessories
compete for attention.  A small back room contains displays for sensual
latex and sturdy BDSM supplies.  Gargoyle's Clothing would delight even the
most discriminating goth customer.

The walls are covered in glossy polaroids of finished work; piercings on
every body part that could hope to have a stud or ring shoved through it.  A
bulletin board houses information about the studio, including but not
limited to licenses for the piercers, flyers for local tattoo artists,
coupons for Gargoyle's Clothing and a list of in-house piercing prices.  The
reception and waiting area are very tidy; sterile despite the dark leather
decor and black curtains.  Behind the counter two small desks face each
other, with a variety of information for clients on piercings, etchings, and
care for body art.  To the east is an opening in the wall with a purple
curtain that can be left open or tugged closed.

This famous chain turns out great live music almost every night of the
week, playing host to famous musicians and up-and-coming innovators every
month.  Where else can you see Dolly Parton on Monday, the Staff Talent Show
on Tuesday and Marilyn Manson on Wednesday?  The bar area is always
exquisite and the dance floor is the place to be for late night action.  A
large stage awaits any scheduled performers while a large balcony area gives
way for the masses of people that pour into this small area for the shows. 
Artist range from the world famous to the employees themselves, all having
been scheduled up on the board of performances at least a month in advance.

`rInside Pentex Corporate Headquarters (Avg. NPCs: 15)`n~
Clean and simple elegance in stone and tile.  A cool quietness seems to
hush the underlying activity in this enormous lobby.  Counters offering a
myriad of service are along the walls and small group settings of chairs,
couches and tables are scattered about for business clients waiting for
their appointments or meetings to begin.  A glance about reading the signs
and listing of businesses in the center leads one to believe that everything
could perhaps be found here, restaurants, a high class hotel, spas, pool,
convention services, international business meetings, foreign language
classes, college learning branch offices, law firms, international brokers -
almost endless possibilities.  With shining floors and a mix of foreign
dress and smiling faces, polite employees with Pentex logo embroidered
shirts escort parties of businessmen to their night-meetings upstairs.

Finished to a high sheen the metal panels reflect light and the bright
red color of the sitting benches at the entrance to the club.  Further
inside a highly polished round dance floor with a DJ booth and hundreds of
lights form the center of the club.  Comfortable, even posh furnishings line
the outside near the windows where overstuffed pillows and deep cushioned
lounges are set into private little groups for the club patrons as the ring
rotates around giving you a full view of the city.  Posh mini bars with
either foot rails and wood, or a back lighted bar top with scoop retro
barstools, the variety of choices are almost endless.  You can also sit at
one of the plasma bars to watch what the Internet feed looks like as the
masses can tune in to the pulse of the club.  Scantily clad waitresses in
tight black or white spandex tops and black short bottoms smile brightly and
enjoy serving the boisterous crowd.

#PHarrah's New Orleans Casino#n~
A chorus of bells, beeps and voices whirl with the twinkle of colored
lights as one enters Harrah's.  The carpet is hideous and brightly hued -
chosen to keep guests' eyes off the floor and on the delights of the casino.
There are gaming tables by the hundred, aisles of flashing slot machines,
electronic and physical roulette wheels, games of Baccarat, and all styles
of popular Poker.  Live entertainment is found on the raised stage near the
far end of the ground floor; usually some crooning lounge singer in a
sparkling evening gown.  Waitresses dodge around the casino bringing drink
orders and packets of cigarettes to guests that don't want to be distracted
from their games long enough to go to the bar.  Signs direct to Jean
Lafittes pirate ship, the Besh Steakhouse, a buffet, the Earl Turner Theater
and the Jazz Court.  The latter is world-renowned for thrilling outdoor jazz
performances under the mossy oaks in the Harrah's ampitheatre.  The light is
kept minimal and soothing, and the fixtures are all gold.

Inside this large and posh bookstore is more like several small libraries
rolled into one.  An amazing collection of the finest literature and very
rare editions graces the shelves here.  Small clusters of chairs lend to
discussion, writing, reading and relaxation if a person grows tired of the
shopping or tourist scene along Pirates Alley.  Famous for the writer
Faulkner, this is a gathering place for writers and would be writers who
flock to the city, hoping for their big break.  A glance out the large
picture windows give a glimpse of the tall decorative wrought iron fencing
and wide doors with arched windows leading back out onto the brightly
painted streets.

`CStudio - Private Residence`n~
Rustic furniture from the twenties, mixed with some newer more modern
pieces make up a comfortable, if rather unkept, residence, with most of the
fixtures, furniture and floors in a pristine condition.  A study off to one
side has completely original furniture, being the place touted where William
Faulkner wrote many of his novels, and its walls are covered in bookshelves
containing novels, dictionaries, and journals of every shape and form.  A
large, oaken desk rests against a far wall, the latter of which is covered
in wide, paneless glass windows from about four feet up to the ceiling, and
is adorned with a plush, green velvet chair.  The kitchen and bathroom here
has been refurbished for more modern conveniences, but masked in matching
colors of deep blue and a lighter green, they meld seamlessly with a small
main area that bears only a small, round coffee table and a large, leather
couch.  The table is almost perpetually unorganized, covered in books,
magazines, and the odd pair of sunglasses.  One pair of cushions bears a
distinct engraving in the brown material, reading 'EMR's spot,' and upon it
is an almost indescript clutter consisting of tiny pairs of shoes and an
assortment of horded trenchcoats.

#pZ'Otz Coffee and Tea House #e-#p (#eAvg. NPCs#p:#e 10#p)#n~
Z'otz provides a welcome haven for the city's displaced bohemian
congregation and artist community who have been at a loss for a caf due to
the insurgence of corporate coffee shops, with their sterile, bland decor
and no-smoking policies.  Housed in one of the older buildings , the
coffeehouse, with its exposed beams and original walls with decades of
fading paint, creates a testament to the history of the city.  Flowers and
plants spill out onto the glitter-dusted sidewalk, and a scarlet
passionflower vine creeps up the power lines and around to the patio.  Cozy
sofas and antique armchairs are filled with people lounging, reading,
studying or just kicking back with their beverage of choice.  The crowd is
mixed, from college students to people who could be parents, remarking with
wistfulness that this place emulates that certain magic the French Quarter
has.  A cast of regulars includes local authors, playwrights,
gallery-owners, producers, designers and film makers that have made this
spot their meeting place.

Other than the posters meant to distract customers while they stare up at
the ceiling, the piercing room is sterile and without decor.  Bright, crisp
lights are on a portable arm that hangs from the ceiling, letting the
piercers direct the light wherever they need it.  A variety of studs,
barbells, rings, and tools are sealed in sterile vacuum packs, stored in a
tidy pull-out cabinet for individual use.  Gloves, drapes, alcohol wipes and
table covers are all neatly arranged on a shelf within easy reach of the
table.  The room always looks ready for the next client.

#wWithin Saint Louis Cathedral#e -#C (#wHoly Ground#e:#w 3#C)#n~
The solemn feeling of this two-hundred-year-old building is overwhelming.  
The roof rises high, and the Spanish-style architecture is evident to the 
trained eye.  The masonry-covered stucco is well tended, as are the pews 
and other articles in the nave.  The main altar is made from a large piece 
of oak, and above it on the wall is a spectacular painting of St.  Louis
proclaiming the Seventh Crusade from the steps of Notre Dame. The grand 
room is lit by the sun, as it shines through the stained-glass windows, as 
well as other windows along the walls, slightly lower.  The sunlight that 
illuminates the stained-glass windows bring out the images presented 
there.  They are of St.  Louis at various stages of his life and 
canonization.  The awe that these holy works infer is sometimes staggering,
as each piece of glass has it's own tale to tell.  To the left of the altar,
against the wall, are the small confessionals.  Across from them, on the
opposite wall, are rows upon rows of candles in a side chapel for St. 
Louis.  There are a few people here, scattered amongst the pews, praying,
weeping, or just sitting collecting their thoughts.  A large umbrella is
stored in a glass case here as well.  A small sign on the case proclaims,
"In case of emergency, break glass."

Entering this apartment it is immediately aware that the person living
here is a heavy smoker, a few windows are generally left open, probably to
fight the smell.  The apartment is rather tidy and furnished with sleek
black furniture, a large screen tv is in one corner and a kitchen that looks
like it's never been used before, sits just to the south where the ground
changes from carpet to tile.  In another corner of the room there is a
bookcase filled with several books, ranging from last weeks newest hot-rods
to the more philosophical books.  A painting portraying a happy family of
four, standing in front of a nice home surrounded by palm trees, hangs from
the wall.  There is an arched door leading to the west, from the looks of
it, a bedroom.

to two phones, a silver one and a older looking brownish grey color.  On the
west wall is a large closet, the door always open for a quick peek at the
clothing, ranging from casual to business.  Several pairs of shoes are
resting on the ground next to the closet.  The first thing that's noticed is
that almost all the clothes are either black or white.

Walking through the apartment door reveals a short hallway that leads
further inside.  Along the right wall hangs a poster titled Goddess Charge,
which includes the quote: "I am the beauty of the green earth and the white
moon, and the mysteries of the waters.  From me all things proceed and unto
me the must return."  On the right wall hangs a second poster titled Moon
Goddess, showing the history and multiple cultures definitions of the
Goddess.  The hallway opens into a large, spacious living room.  A new couch
sits along the left wall with a coffee table in front of it, and a very
small entertainment center along the right wall.  A small TV, a DVD player,
and a stereo system sit in various locations inside the entertainment
center.  Movies line the shelves, and a few candles sit on the top.  The
window directly ahead has full bookcases on either side of it.  The book
themes range from fantasy, sci-fi, witchcraft, photography, astrology,
mythology, meditation, music, art, writing and a few others.  In front of
the window hangs a wind chime shaped like a pentagram.  Faux stones surround
the outer edge, with 5 bells hanging from the bottom.  The kitchen around
the corner has cupboards lining the walls, and a small wrap-around counter,
with two barstools along the side near the living room.  A small fridge sits
in the corner, with a small coffee pot and microwave on the counter top
beside it.  Another small hallway near the entertainment center leads
further into the apartment.

The hallway has three doors, and the walls are covered with photographs
taken by Judy Francesconi and Tanya Chalkin.  Most of the photographs are
tasteful black and whites of women in romantic scenes together, or single
nudes.  A door near the end of the hallway on the right leads to the master
bedroom.  The first door on the left leads into a small bathroom and the
second door to the left opens into a small bedroom, with a futon directly
across from the door.  Along the left wall of the bedroom is a computer desk
that wraps around the corner, with a comfortable looking chair in front of
it.  A computer system sits on the desk, and the small hutch is filled with
random computer software, games, and manuals.  A few Dungeons and Dragons
books sit on one corner of the desk in a neat stack.  The walls are
decorated with pictures depicting fantasy scenes including dragons,
unicorns, wizards and castles.

#BApartment C - Master Bedroom#n~
The bedroom opens up into a decent sized room.  A closet entrance is
directly beside the door and a queen-sized bed to the left.  Several pillows
and a thick comforter made up of deep blue and gray swirls lie on the bed. 
A small end table sits on each side of the bed.  An alarm clock sits on the
right side, and the other has a frame with an 8x10 photo, both showing two
laughing women in a loving embrace.  One is young, tall Hispanic woman, and
the other is a shorter blonde woman who looks a little older.  The frame
shines silver, and engraved along the bottom are the words 'When you have
learned to love, you will have learned to live.  ' Another frame hangs on
the wall above the headboard, black with the words 'Life goes on and so must
we.  ' Inside is a background of black satin, with two white gold rings tied
in place.  The room seems bare with the few pieces of furniture, and the few
decorations give it a very somber feel.

A shiny little crystal dangling above the doorway greets everyone who
enters, as does the whiff of patchouli from the seemingly ever-present
incense.  A medium-sized television sits against a light green wall with a
DVD, VCR, PlayStation 2, and an assortment of jewel cases, discs and tapes
beside it.  A poofy grey leather couch with the occasional throw pillow
provides ultimate gaming comfort, especially with the dim lighting.  A
couple of black-and-white, artsy-fartsy pictures of girls with astonishing
eyes bedeck the wall.  The east wall boasts a well-stocked kitchen, full of
many sweet things, a plethora of marshmallows, and a couple of packs of
Camel Wide Lights.  Thick, thick drapes cover a tiny window in the kitchen..
Every wall in the room seems to bear a mirror, each with a tiny little crack
on the corner.  To the south, a small exclamation point painted on a door
marks a bedroom, and to the west another door marks a study.

#BApartment B #e-#B Sleepy Room!#n~
The master bedroom is beautifully designed, and pretty extravagant in its
attempts for comfort.  The walls have been painted a flat deep red,
darkening the room considerably.  Long, dark purple velvet drapes enclose
the west wall's blanketed bed, the folds and ripples of the cloth gathering
onto the wood floor and dramatizing the importance of the rest area.  Tiny
candles peppered throughout the room provide intimate, romantic ambiance,
reflecting on a large mirror with a crack in it on a wall.  A lonely
narcissus in a purple vase rests on a night stand beside the bed, adding a
hint of nostalgia to the room.  An elegant desk with a few books and papers
with messy scribblings atop occupies one side of the room, beside a closet
of clothes.  Ashes of old incense fill the room with a calming patchouli
smell.  A small door to the west marks a bathroom.

#BApartment B #e-#B Shining Bathroom!#n~
The bathroom is very, very clean and white, and smells of tea, likely
from the soap on the counter.  Many bath products deck the walls, ibuprofen,
acetaminophen, cough syrup, Loritab, and band-aids behind the mirror for any
ailing guests.  Every cleansing product in here seems to be organic, from
toothpaste to shampoo to hand soap.  This is the only room in the house in
which the lighting is stark-white, the tile on the walls and floor only
accentuating the whiteness.  The towels and hand-towels are fuzzy white,
adorned with small black embroidered exclamation points in the center, and a
single fresh white rose rests in a modest vase by the shell-shaped sink. 
The door back to the west signifies return from the picture of cleanliness,
and a welcome back to the real world.

#BApartment F #e- #BLiving Room#n~
The most striking thing about this apartment is the atmosphere: Dim
lighting, dark red walls and the rich jewel tones of East Indian decor grant
the place a relaxing, if not mysterious air.  A mahogany coffee table
occupies the center of the room, surrounded by plush beaded cushions in
place of chairs.  An inviting overstuffed couch faces a television in one
corner, and the remainder of the space is claimed by a small kitchen area
with a lovely wine rack.  Observant visitors may notice that blackout
curtains hang behind the richly colored draperies covering the windows.  A
bead-curtained doorway leads to what must be the bedroom.  There is
absolutely no plastic in the home, save for the television set, which has
been covered with a fine woven cloth in red and gold threads.

#BApartment F #e- #BBedroom#n~
The mysterious, inviting atmosphere of the apartment is magnified in the
bedroom.  A beautiful canopy bed is the centerpiece, decorated in the same
rich tones as everything else and piled with soft, comfortable pillows.  One
of the wine-colored walls holds a dressing table and full-length mirror
beside the closet door, and a bathroom branches from another.

The bathroom is small and fairly ordinary, tiled in deep green with gold
accenting all of the faucets.  There is a bath/shower built into one of the
walls, and a cabinet that holds fluffy towels and other necessities.  The
cosmetics are limited to things only in glass bottles, with absolutely no
plastic anywhere, and the items themselves are summed up as 'necessary,'
with no make-up or vanity supplicants to be spoken of.

#BApartment E #e- #BLiving Room#n~
This living room is small, and sparcely furnished.  A wide-screen TV is
placed on a stand against one wall, a sofa across from it.  In front of the
sofa, a coffee table is placed, a laptop sitting on top of it along with a
few sheets of paper.  A door to the south leads into the bedroom, while one
to the west leads into a makeshift office, and the last one to the east
leads into the kitchen.

#BApartment E #e-#B Kitchen#n~
This room serves as both a kitchen and dining room, a small circular
table placed down in one part of it.  The kitchen is well-kept, and very
clean, though it might be because it's almost never used.  A large
refrigerator is well-stocked, as is the pantry, though the freshness of the
foods cannot be guaranteed.  The counter has few appliances, and all don't
look like they are used often.

door has a small letter in black, giving the address of the apartment.  A
cast iron fire escape leads up to a locked door at the landing, right up
beneath the ceiling.

#pLoft over Burgundy Street#n~
The floor is honey pine hardwood, weathered by the years of many
footsteps thudding against its surface.  The walls are almost entirely
populated by shelves varying in size, packed with books from every genre - a
set of old encyclopedias with red canvas covers, collections of youth
literature like The Boxcar Children and Goosebumps, classic pieces like the
Odyssey or Grapes of Wrath and junk paperbacks, Stephen King and Jim
Butcher, crowd many of the shelves, intermingled with hordes of spiral
notepads and manuscript booklets.  There are old mason jars filled with pens
and pencils just about everywhere, and a plastic globe that lights up from
the inside up top of one of the shorter shelves.  Furniture is sparse but
comfortable.  A squashy black suede sofa is the centerpiece, sitting in an L
shape with a large reclining easy chair made of the same fabric.  A thick
red shag carpet is thrown across the floor of the seating area.  There is a
flat screen television the size of a small movie projector mounted on the
wall, and a basket packed with DVDs beneath it.  A few framed newspaper
clippings are here and there, most of them scathingly negative reviews about
H.  Harvey's writing.  On the furthest end of the loft beneath a bare
hanging bulb the balcony door is a bed with a thick array of blankets piled
on top.  None are in any particular order, but they follow a color scheme of
red and black.  The bed frame is majestic and dark wood, with four posts
reaching high toward the ceiling.  There is a kitchenette with a simple
cooktop, some black-painted cabinets, a sink, fridge and microwave.  The
bathroom is behind a plywood door covered with graffiti.

`pMain Bar at Club Equinox `e(`pAvg`e.`p NPCs`e:`p 24`e)`n~
Here at the cash bar people can cluster and talk, a bit away from all the
lights and noise of the dance floor.  Offering all the same drinks and
services as the main bar, but accepting cash only.  A bit quieter, perhaps
more secluded, it is a nice place to take a break from the club scene. 
Across the large and spacious hallway is the glass encased VIP room.

`pVIP Room at Club Equinox `e(`pAvg`e.`p NPCs`e:`p 0`e)`n~
A glass room accommodating six to eight people with its very own private
waitress.  Very plush in furnishings, the room can be hidden behind curtains
for a private party or meeting.  If preferred the curtains can be pushed
aside so the room can be looked out of and the club scene or the view beyond
the outer ring of New Orleans can be enjoyed.  The room also includes two
separate flat screen monitors, its own controllable lighting and a sound
system for meetings, business deals or private showings.

`wRuins of the Saenger Theatre`n~
A vast expanse of velvet cushioned seating sits in tiers winding down
toward the main floor, where the grand suite and VIP seating lies directly
before the ornate stage.  Architecture designed purposely in homage to the
giant inner patios of baroque Italian villas is a striking sight, even with
seats broken and pushed over, cushions torn and mold - even the occasional
wild vine that has forced it's way through the cracked foundation - creeping
in to corrupt the Victorian beauty.  Fountains to the sides contain
stagnant, green water, while stone walls, arches and fancy mouldings along
the sides of the building create a faux-courtyard, once an impressive
display.  Spires with burned out bulbs on the casements above speckle a
mural of a dark painted sky across the high, vaulted ceiling.  A broad stage
with ornate carvings and mouldings with hammered gold that has been chipped
away by thieves sits at the forefront of the theatre, with a deep green
plush curtain hiding the tightly packed set pieces behind.  An enormous
Morton pipe organ, simply too large to steal, sits off to the right-hand
side of the stage, touted as being the largest ever made by the company that
borne it.  Most of the seating is cushioned in scarlet red, with the
mezzanine in dark green; the sole exception to this color theme is the grand
suite seating, which is composed of majestic, massive posh thrones with
individualized name plates.  A heavy layer of dust coats everything,
disturbed in places with footprints or handprints.

`wRuins of the Saenger Theatre Backstage`n~
A maze of corridors and side rooms, dressing rooms, prop rooms and
changing areas fan off of the main backstage area, where the stage can be
seen at a side view, but not the place the audience would have sat.  With a
once finely polished wood floor that matches the stage, a series of moldy
curtains in folds, often hiding clouds of gnats, moths or bats, and a few
high stools for seating, the aura is one of hushed anticipation even when
the theatre is empty and destitute, as it is now.  A cabinet and two sets of
shelving just behind a partition supports a myriad of last minute things
that may have once been needed; old pots of makeup, thread in various faded
colors, buttons, tape, first aid supplies and smelling salts.  A comfortable
looking pair of couches sets further back from possible sight of anyone on
stage or in the audience and has thick throw pillows tossed haphazardly upon
them.

#RF#runky #RP#rirate #RB#rar and #RP#ratio #R(#rAvg. NPCs: 4#R)#n~
Dimly lit and having bright neon bar signs, beer signs, multicolored
stage lights and television screens scattered about the room, this
establishment is a typical watering hole off of the busy city streets. 
Having little main floor seating instead opting for open space to dance and
mingle, but sporting side and back raised seating all visitors are assured
of a view of the decoratively railed stage for the live bands that play on
occasion.  With music, bands and the ever-present karaoke time, this bar is
oriented around what tourists expect.  Towards the back, large doors open
onto a beer garden complete with fountain, night lighting and more screens
outdoors.  The famous shot girls can be seen outside in the garden as well,
where customers await their ordered shots.

Opening onto a large square courtyard, with a center fountain having
water shooting through flames this makes an interesting setting to sit with
friends and acquaintances.  Along the back wall is a fully stocked bar and
over to the left side a small bar sells beer in the can or shots only.  High
tables are surrounded by equally tall barstools and the area is surrounded
by wrought-iron lattice fencing.  A few neon signs also give colored light
to the area, but not enough to spoil the view of the fountain.

A bright and friendly looking main dining area has sheer white curtain
panels framed by sunny yellow scalloped draperies.  With pale carpet, muted
maroon upholstered chairs and white linen tablecloths, the overall
impression is of luxurious airiness.  White rose trellises covered in roses
and the brighter colors enhance the long standing history of this popular
restaurant.  White clad waiters and waitresses move quietly and quickly
around tending to the guests.  Muted sounds from the upscale chefs area
filter out into the dining room assuring guests the ordered items will
arrive as soon as they reach perfection.

comfortable dark wrought iron chairs all covered with a forest of large

side pots, and on elegant vases on each table.  With softly swaying trees
overhead and beautiful landscaping along the high bricks, the patio is
easily privatized from the busy street just over the wall.

#wA Small Alley Off Bourbon #e- #w(#eAve NPCs#w:5#w)#n~
This small street is more like an alleyway compared to the other local
streets.  However, due to its closeness to Bourbon Street, tourists still
trickle down through this area, especially to go to the secluded bars.  The
open doors of the #e#eRawhide Bar#n draw in tourists from the distance of the
main street. The club to the east has been completely gutted by flame, and
looks as though a huge explosion occured inside of it. It has been closed
off by barricades.

Sporting a sign made of old instrument cases, and large ironwork archway
with grill-style gate in the French Quarter leads into a large hall that
used to be an art gallery.  Some of the paintings from that gallery still
can be seen on the walls, but the hall itself is sparsely furnished with
some wood benches and large pillows for guests to be seated on.  Many will
have stand or lean against the back wall, to hear the performance.  A fully
packed room would still only hold about sixty or seventy patrons and the
band that fills the air with the sounds of that special style only known as
"New Orleans Jazz".

space has tables, chairs and a few couches for reading, making notes, or
working on research papers.  Lamps are spaced evenly on the tables and some
overhead lighting is placed strategically where the rows of books are to
provide light for locating the volume or book being sought out.

Gold leaf wallpaper, with plush red mixed in gives this entryway and desk
area the look and feel of what all tourists would expect in New Orleans. 
There are thickly padded plush chairs set in small groups on the right, with
lamps and soft lighting.  Liveried bellhops, and uniformed maids help the
overall atmosphere reek of luxury, and yet it is still affordable to most
families coming to see the city on the river.  A light faux marble
countertop and two computer terminals are on the left with employees smiling
while waiting on guests.  Elevators are straight away from the arching
double entry doors and hallways lead off to both sides.  Scripted gold
lettering on a dark blue background announces the lounge down the left
hallway and the arcade and snack bar to the right.

teens and pre-teens hover around the more popular of the games, watching
their friends as they all race to see who is the king of the arcade.  The
snack bar makes the room smell of buttered popcorn and caramel apples, while
a few employees are kept busy cleaning up the constant barrage of gum
wrappers, candy wrappers and spilled soda.

system and a small bar with an older smiling barkeep behind it.  Small round
tables with sets of three or four chairs around them, and few comfortable
booths against the far wall allow for numerous patrons to be seated and
served here.  Small colored glass bowls have flickering tea light candles in
them, and a waitress circulates about the room, cleaning tables or using a
push vacuum to clean the rug.

Upholstered settees with gilded arms and back rests, sit amidst Persian

roasting meat emanate from an archway to the left and a long elegant dining
table can be seen already set for the next meal.  A hallway leads off the
archway to the right and the first door that can be seen has Suite A
stenciled onto its surface.  An antique roll-top desk is just inside the
entry door and a bell has a small placard announcing ring bell for service.

heavier elegant white with gold finger draperies can be pulled at night for
privacy.  The coverlet on the bed and the matching decorative pillows also
are off-white with gold trimmings.  An antique armoire with double doors
opens to reveal television, stereo and video equipment.  A bell pull at the
door with posted instructions indicates that if room service is requested,
simply tug on the pull anytime before midnight.

antiseptic are the common sights and smells for a hospital.  A large thick
curtain can be pulled across the center of the room to separate the two beds
for privacy.  One padded guest chair sits under the television and there are
two rolling tables high enough to push over the bed for meals.  A private
restroom is just off the entrance door and has a sink, toilet and shower
with a bench in it.

paintings of the French Quarter.  Each door looks almost exactly as the
next, all having a small electronic box for sliding the card key for access
to the rooms.  The only difference between each door is the number in black.

A long wood bar and modern black menus with easy-to-read print mounted on
the wall behind it.  Workers in black clothes under green Starbucks aprons
smile and ask what concoction they might create for the flow of customers
that move through the cafe each night.  A variety of biscottis, roasted
coffee beans, gourmet candies and branded coffee mugs are displayed for sale
at unreasonable prices.  The smell here is of coffee, chocolate and dairy
foam.  Every few seconds the steamy schhtooooock of milk being steamed
pierces the conversations of customers.  A few small tables and chairs are
spaced gingerly throughout the cafe.

#wInside Canal Place Shopping Center#n~
Wide tile walkways and pale marble walls lend graceful elegance to the
Canal Place Shopping Center.  Having artwork, plenty of light and sculpted
indoor foliage provides an upper class atmosphere to an area that is
decidedly not upper class.  The selection of shops suggests an attempt on
the part of the mall to bring money back into Midtown.  Gucci, Bally, and
Laura Ashley are pushed with as much ferocity here as drugs are in other
parts of the city.  Fanciful wrought iron benches near the tinkling fountain
gives customers a place to lounge, and the security guards something to
occupy themselves whenever a drifter stops to rest his eyes.  #oStarbucks
Coffee#n is to the east behind a wall of glass panes, glowing clean against
the backdrop of the Boardwalk.

as well as Linens - with designer clothing for children and infants as well

competition is high between Saks Fifth Avenue, The Limited, and Weinsteins,
a seller of an exclusive line of Italian designer labels.  A large central
area with padded benches, plants, and lighted store directories indicates
the center of the mall.

#wElevator at Canal Place#n~
With tough, indoor-outdoor carpet on the floor, metal sides designed to
look like wood, and a sturdy waist high hand rail around the sides and back,
this is a quite a boring elevator to step into.  The most redeeming
qualities of the elevator are that there is no piped in cheesy music and the
ride to the parking garage is only a short one.

Large movies posters of current and soon to come movies hang on all the
walls.  The walls themselves are black, with small silver stars painted
everywhere, giving the room a night time feeling.  Immediately as you enter,
you come to a ticket booth, to buy tickets to whatever show might be playing
that night.  Just past the admission stand is a large glass counter,
covering several types of candy and snacks one might be interested in
purchasing.  A drink machine sits behind the counter, allowing employees to
fill drinks with ease.  Several popcorn machines are placed along the
counter, filled with light, buttery popcorn.  Warmers hold nachos, hot dogs,
and a variety of other warm foods.  Benches sit against the outside wall,
allowing whoever might wish to sit, a place to rest.

You enter into a large room, filled with soft seats placed with each row
just slightly above the row before.  The floor is littered with spilled
popcorn and sticky, dried soda.  The walkways leading up to the seats are
lined with tiny lights, placed so one would not stray from the walkway until
a seat has been found.  In the front of the room a large screen shows
advertisements for all those who wait on the movie.  The air is chilled but
quiet, in anticipation of the movie.

cornor is a stero system set up with surround sound.  In front of the only
window in the room theirs a fifty inch flat screen tv sitting in a large
entertainment system.  Pictures of a young couple are placed around all over
it.  A small fan light hangs from the room.  Their is a large leather couch
sitting infront of the tv, and a love seat alittle bits away from that.  A
phone hangs on the wall near the opening to the kitchen.

`cApartment B`n -`c Aiden's Room`n~
The walls here above a dark blue border that is pasted three feet above
the floor level are a pale blue, and below the border wallpaper with darker
blue vertical stripes covers to the baseboard atop a dark green background. 
The floor is thickly carpeted, and at the center of the ceiling is a bright
fixture with four glass-enclosed bulbs, bearing a fan that lazily pushes the
air about the room so as to keep it cooler.  Twin mattresses are nestled
carefully into a bedframe fashioned to look like a large, wheeled racecar,
the head bearing a few pillows and the foot appearing to be the 'front' of
the car, with two working headlights that can be switched on by a button on
the side, functioning as nightlights.  Soft blankets and quilts stitched
with cars, trains and other such things are tucked above dark blue sheets,
and a one-eyed stuffed bear sits atop the pillows at the head.  The room is
absolutely filled with toys; an intricate train set with a track that
stretches on a wooden frame all around the room, up toward the ceiling,
around the bed and through a series of shelves with endless childrens books
filling them.  There is a large teak chest with a non-working lock set
against one wall, packed to the absolute brim with toys of all colours,
sizes and types.  A brightly coloured rug of blue and green sits in front of
the toy chest, and this room is kept remarkably clean, down to having no
dust on the posters of Bob the Builder that cover the walls.

`cApartment B`n -`c Living Room`n~
This is a fairly open and cozy space, stretching out into a small,
sparklingly clean kitchen seperated from the main living room by an island
style bar set with three elegant Dyre barstools.  The floor is a light,
polished hardwood, and littered every here and there with a childrens toy of
some kind, all of which seem to spread out from the epicenter of a large
teak toy-chest set against the western wall.  A circular rug of clean
knotted rya acts as midpoint to a nice living space, bordered on one side by
a comfortable overstuffed blue sofa, another side by a huge, well-worn
leather chair with a smaller one set next to it.  A fair sized television
sits in an oak entertainment center with glass doors, along with a stereo
and several CDs and DVDs, all of which media is targeted toward the audience
of a child.  Several small lamps sit on end tables, casting calming light
over the room.  There are four large bowls set in the kitchen, two with dog
kibble, the other two with water.  A pair of simple white painted wood doors
lead east and north.

`cApartment B`n -`c Master Bedroom`n~
This is the larger of the two bedrooms of the apartment, rather
simplistic in decor and design.  A queen-sized bed with a few blue and cream
colored throw blankets folded up at the end is the forefront object of note,
laden with more pillows than would likely be the norm, and enclosed within a
solid oak, four poster frame.  A large desk is pushed up against one wall,
under a wide window covered with a sheer blue curtain trimmed in white lace,
along with pull down shades and dark shutters with close off on the outside.
The light hardwood floor is consistant with that in the living room, and is
graced with a thick knotted rya rug.  The room appears entirely devoid of
television or electronics, but has a low, light polished two-shelved
bookcase with a collection of older books from all the normal areas of
literature.  A small private bath is through a mundane archway in one wall. 
The lighting is soft and speaks of morning sunlight, dim yet somehow
cleansing.

#rThe Zydeco #e- #r(#eAvg#r.#e NPCs#r:#e8#r)#n~
Dim lights, a hazy interior and raised voices blend to create a curiously
pleasing atmosphere in this large, single room bar.  Neon beer signs and
stained glass lampos hanging from long chains over the booth tables give off
enough light to play a game of eight ball or discuss the days events with
friends.  Tall barstools are nudged up against a brass foot rail at the
large semi-circular bar, and private booths line the length of one whole
wall.  The center of the bar is dominated by a pool table and large, round
card table with stacks of poker chips and playing cards in the middle.  An
older jukebox sits just inside the door, sporting rock and roll songs from
the '70s.  A sign above the back bar wall reads "I have the right to refuse
service to anyone, including you!"  And is signed "Sam."  The small back
door is locked.

`rLoft Above the Zydeco`n~
After climbing exiting the hatch leading to this modern residence above
the Zydeco, you find yourself in a living room of sorts.  The hatch opens in
the left hand corner of the room, and on the directly to your left a doorway
has been cut out, leading to a room shining with fluorescent lighting.  In
the middle of the room, a black leather sofa sits, new and leased.  A few
feet in front of that, a medium-sized television is balanced on a small
wooden platform.  A few cheap, deviant art pictures adorn the walls, which
are painted a mocha brown color.  The carpet matches the walls, and .  On
the south wall, there is a sliding glass door leading to a balcony, and a
plain wooden door lies in the east wall of the room.

The thick smoke in this room seems to curl in the air and is able to make
someone choke upon entering.  Peanut shells and broken glass from the last
fight crunch under the least bit of weight put upon the floor.  A number of
tables sit scattered about the room while the chairs are misplaced all
about.  Each chair seems to be a bit different, and in worse condition than
the next.  Half-filled and empty glasses rest on the top of several tables,
while spilled liquor is dried upon the bar, making the surface sticky, and
unpleasant to the touch.  A single lamp hangs from the ceiling, lighting
this room only scarcly, making most everything dark.

After making your way out of the living room and through the sliding
glass door, a decently-sized balcony opens up on the outside of the
building, overlooking Bourbon street from two stories up.  A small patio
table set is near the guardrail, and a pot of white tulips is set on either
side of the balcony, and a tiny planter of green foliage is set in the
middle of the table.  An old coffee cup or two has been left on the railing
and table, perhaps showing insight in the homeowner's coffee drinking
habits, or their laziness.

Thick-bodied live oaks, broad branches draped in a heavy curtain of 
graying Spanish moss, form a sky barring canopy over the lined asphalt of 
the road cutting away the view of the lakes murky welcoming waters, the 
shore hidden just beyond the lush undergrowth of native brush and vibrant 
splashes of wild magnolia and crepe myrtles. Wild shocks of berries grow 
in dotted groupings, covering the few places that the lush canopy over 
head allows the nurturing sun to spot through. Dirt pathways worn by the 
passing of footsteps both human and wildlife link the road side to the 
pebbled shore allowing passage to the waters edge. A battered wooden 
picnic table perches where grass meets pebbled shore, the green paint 
flecking away with time and weather the remains of a stone ringed fire 
pit not far off.

Stepping up a pair of rough wood steps leads customers into an
atmospheric, dimly lit bar filled with the sounds of rock and roll.  The
hard wood floors are stained deep chestnut brown, well worn-in and burnished
with age.  The lower third of the walls are treated with paneling that
matches the tone and texture of the floorboards.  The top two thirds are
covered in black fabric.  Beams in the exposed ceiling hold the roof up;
dangling down are heavy glass shades with beer logos painted on.  The booths
that frame the bar are each pushed into their own archways, creating a
recessed look for the seating spaces.  Hard wood tables with round tops fill
the open space in the middle of the room, with a long bar running up the
wall left of the entrance.  An elevated stage takes up the entire back wall
of the building, with heavy black curtains framed around the opening. 
Velvet lined poker tables and roulette wheels sit atop the stage.  A huge
bulletin board that takes up a huge portion of wall space is near the door,
tacked with phone numbers, cards, flyers and other bits of paper.

`R=`rLoft above the Rising Sun`R=`n~
Tall walls of thick, dark redwood encircle this room with an unmistakable
feel of warm comfort.  There is not a single inch, save for the spaces
allowed for the deeply crimson painted doors which provide access in and out
of the room from the west and southern sides, edged gracefully around the
frames in ivory coloured crown moulding, that is not packed from ceiling to
floor in massive cherrywood shelves.  The strong odor of the books beyond
logical count swirls tantalizingly to the nose with the twisting jasmine
smoke of the cannisters placed methodically upon small polished shelves or
what there is of the shelving not actively occupied by books.  The floor is
padded by a thick, circular carpet of dark, nearly black red that has been
woven and embroidered with exquisitely unique patterns, and causes each
footfall to sink into it by at least an inch.  Several dozen chairs fit for
the Gods - crafted of fine, genuine red leather with pewter fastenings upon
the arms and skirts, and lullingly comfortable cushions upon regal, winged
backs - have been placed in every corner of the room next to round tables,
topped by surfaces no larger than the circumference of a dinner plate, upon
which a small lamp made of pewter with a dark red glass shade sits, able to
be turned on by a tug of the glass-beaded chain.  There is a trap door in
the ceiling, but no apparant way to access it.  The western door sits
partially open, revealing a rectangular orange glow from the fireplace
beyond it.

`R=`rAltar`R=`n~
This is a moderate loft space made small by a huge, upraised dais of
dark-stained cherrywood, laced with dark gossamar that hangs in graceful
draping arcs from all sides.  Incense burns from several pewter cannisters
set at several locations throughout the loft, sending delicate spirals of
piquantly fragranced smoke swirling into the air.  In black porcelin pots
that are arranged upon several dark cherrywood shelves have been planted
small rosebushes with luminescent, black blooms.  The soil in the pots is
stained crimson, and a gourd is set beside it with an accordingly crimson
stained mouth.  Upon a broad, pewter altar that has been constructed to the
top of the dais is a dagger and several chalices.

#wLiving Room and Kitchen#n~
Entering the room from below you are greeted by a small alcove cut off
from the rest of the room, the hardwood floor highly polished, a metal coat
rack to your left.  Stepping into the actual living room you come upon two
large black overstuffed couches facing each other in the center of the room,
pillows in various shades of gray and white dotted over them.  A hardwood
coffee table resides in between them, a dog-eared copy of the Kama Sutra
teetering on the edge amidst various notebooks and pens.  A light gray
leather chair sits catty corner to the couches rounding off the seating
area, a hardwood end table tucked in beside it.  A ceiling fan with
lightwood colored blades goes full blast overhead giving the condo a
noticeable chill.  A woven zebra print area rug, of thick piled wool, covers
the common brown barber carpet.  Nondescript lamps dot the room giving it a
welcoming glow.  The wall furthest from the front door acts as an archway
with a breakfast bar set into it, leading into an open floor planned
kitchen.  Three padded wooden swivel stools with wooden backs are nestled up
to the marble topped breakfast bar accounting for an informal dining area. 
The eastern wall of the living room is covered in matted black and white
still life photos, a nice sound system resting on an old oriental style
sidebar tucked below.  The walls of the living room are done in a sage green
offering a relaxing backdrop for the windowless room.  A tall grandfather
clock rests along with a large hardwood television cabinet along the western
wall.  Walking though the archway into the kitchen, you feet fall upon a
light stained hardwood floor.  An island with green marble top dominates the
room, a sink and cook top both set into it.  Glass fronted cabinets show
decretive colored glasses and plates along with functional every day items. 
The backsplash and countertops are done in various colors of painted tiles
giving the plum painted room a warm feel.  A large oak door can be seen down
a small hallway near the kitchens.

#wOthello's Bedroom#n~
Entering through the closed wooden door you notice the floor is covered
in a thick muffling sage colored carpet, your feet almost sink into.  The
walls themselves are done in a Venison plaster treatment tinted a pale sage
with a thick crown molding and chair rail.  Heavy black velvet drapes cover
the two large windows of the room on the west wall looking as if they are
rarely drawn open next to the windows is a set of double french doors that
lead the small unused balcony on the front of the building.  A large queen
sized bed is nestled under the two windows, covered in mismatched sheets and
three or four pillows tossed toward the head of it.  A thick feather
comforter lays draped across the foot, as if a half attempt was made to make
the bed.  The south wall of the room has two doorways, one leading to a bath
room, the other draped in a thick black cloth, a half closed door behind it.
Between the two doors rests a long dresser painted black, a small television
and DVD player resting on top of it along with a few framed pictures and
some loose change in an open carved wood box.  Glancing into the bathroom
you can see a large spa style tub made for soaking, with a glass enclosed
shower just off to the side.  A long counter top holds the sink and various
grooming products topped by an unadorned mirror.  Happening to glance into
the other black draped doorway you find a small professional style dark
room, various black and white photos still hanging on a line to dry.  Making
your way back out into the bedroom proper a glance at the northern wall
shows a free style weight set tucked into the corner furthest from the door,
a set of shorts tossed on the bench.  A large leather chair and footstool
share the same wall, an end table shoved in beside them not far from an
expensive looking camera on a tripod.  A dark wood ceiling fan rotates at a
lazy pace overhead standing out against the black painted ceiling.

`R=`rConference Room at the Rising Sun`R=`n~
Larger than it's eastern counterpart, this could accurately be described
as a conferance room.  Perhaps fifteen by thirty in size with a remarkably
high ceiling bordered with ivory coloured crown moulding that elegantly
offsets the deep scarlet walls and a thickly carpeted floor, the room does
have it's touches of personality despite it's large size.  The wood of the
walls beyond the paint is a natural dark ebony, and in meticulously arranged
silver frames that hang in a combunation of of verticals and diagonals the
visages of men and women smile, scowl or look calmly into the air from
behind two-dimensional oil-painted eyes.  Small silver plates attached to
the frames label each portrait with a name.  A long, stout table lined with
large red leather chairs fills the majority of this room, and from the
center of the table the scent of white chrysanthemums drift into the air
from a transparant red glass vase.  Despite the professional air, the room
has a feel of being well taken care of, and the smell of the ancient tomes
mixing seductively with the jasmine smoke that drifts in from the other room
is very much a present force of comfort even when the door to the east is
closed.  A huge polished red and black marble hearth in the northern wall is
heavily blocked off so that the flames have no chance of doing anything but
seeping warmth into the room.  Is supplies the whole of the light in this
room.

`rApartment A `e- `rLiving Room`n~
A dimly lit and mellow quality graces this room from various small
spotlights dotting across the ceiling, washing the room in half-shadow and
half-light.  The room is quite large and sparsely decorated, the large
window overlooking the street covered completely by a thick black velvet
curtain obscuring any view from within or out, unless one was to move it. 
There lays a formation of two squashy-looking, black leather couches and a
matching chair almost directly in the center of the space, sitting around a
glass coffee table with a large TV within watching distance.  A little space
is carved out of the room to make-shift as a kitchen, containing only the
basics of a fridge, sink, counter-top and stove, however their design is
in-keeping with the mellow feel of the room itself.  Nothing else is of much
note within the room, bar a collection of guitars sitting around the room in
various positions.  A door to the south leads to a bathroom, while a door
west leads to a bedroom.

which is draped in dark linen.  The bed itself takes up most of this rather
compromising space, however the room allows for the addition of a small
mahogany desk and matching chair, and a closet of the same hue.

thousand dollars.  A wardrobe stands dusty in the corner, not opened for
some time, a piece of green silk on the top with a vase, which is covered in
a pattern of a rosevine.

even lower cupboards, which start at about shoulder height.  The stove and
oven are built into the counter, and a small white microwave is hooked into
the wall below a cupboard.  The cupboards are made of cherry oak, and
eclipse the rest of the otherwise plain kitchen with their beauty.  The
countertops are white tile, and a dishwasher is located at the far end of
the kitchen.  A plain white refrigerator is slid against the wall where the
counter ends.

color as the living room, and there is a small wet bar in the corner of the

left on the nightstand which sits next to the bed.

`bEight Days of Luke Mortuary`n~
A wash of elegance and rich dark colors subdue the senses upon entering
this Victorian foyer; the scent of jasmine and cloves hangs lightly in the
warm air, filtering to the noses of patrons from the tiny orange flames of
stout votive candles, floating upon the surface of water filled sconces that
line the dark cherry-stained wooden panels which make up the walls.  Rolls
of raw silks in sultry indigo panel the lower half of the panelled walls,
and a fireplace tiled in gold chased onyx burns consistantly, seeping
comfortable warmth into the room from the southernmost point; before the
fire sit three plump, beautiful chairs lined in immaculate sable velvet with
gold fastenings, each set with a circular tasselled cushion of the same
fabric and hue.  The floor is an illustriously polished red wood with a dark
tint, and each door is painted a shade of lovely black.  The door to the
east bears a solid lock installed into the gothic-iron, old-fashioned
handle.  A subtle, dark stained wooden crucifix is mounted above the double
doors to the south, and to the west is the show room.

`bOffice at Eight Days of Luke`n~
The office of the mortuary is a dark, feminine affair, the walls being of
solid ebony wood panelling and a high, painted ceiling depicting the
hallowed figures of unusually gaunt angels engaged in battle with their
demonic counterparts before the gates of Heaven in dark frescos.  A heavy
mahogany desk supports a slim Compaq notebook in silver, and stacks of
yellow legal pads filled with page upon page of the same spikey, elegant
handwriting.  A cot has been folded up and placed against the wall opposite
the desk, with a white-slipped pillow atop it's closed, stout build.  A pair
of speakers installed at the crease of wall to ceiling filter the soft,
morbid melody of the nocturnes at a whispers volume, and tiny, circular
votive candles who's glassy scarlet wax can be seen through the clear sides
of their holders offer various dusky scents, from cherry and vanilla to the
more gentle suggestion of jasmine and cinnamon.  An oval, faux Persian rug
is spread across the panelled wood flooring, and the walls contain only one
item of decor, being a framed color photograph of a voluptuous raven-haired
girl stood between two similarly featured, older individuals, one male and
the other female.

`bCoffin show-room at Eight Days of Luke Mortuary`n~
Following the same somber, subdued colors of the rest of the building,
this room is used to display the various types of caskets and urns that can
be purchased to contain the dead in their final repose.  The long room is
lit with soft, overhead fluorescents to eliminate glare from the smooth,
lacquered woods and burnished metals of the coffins.  The coffins arranged
along the walls all have the upper half open to display the plush, tasteful
interiors and each style bears a name such as 'The Elite', 'The Valley',
'Simplicity', or 'The Cathedral' along with a small chart indicating
available colors.  Between each casket, a wide selection of urns is
displayed, each on a simple pedestal.  Mahogany double doors lead back out
to the entry hall.

`bChapel at Eight Days of Luke Mortuary`n~
A circular, high-ceilinged room with tiny sprays of colored light
glinting against the panelled, dark-stained cherry-wood walls from broad,
religious stained glass windows depicting all things from the fall of Samuel
and the parting of the Red Sea by Moses, to the ascension of Christ into
Heaven.  Despite these vividly beautiful stories encircling round, all
design by means of architecture is intended to draw attention front and
center, to the small mahogany pulpit.  Rich indigo carpet complements the
dark mahogany wood of the pulpit and matching rows of pews, standing in
stark contrast to the runners of pristine white silk.  The line of the
southern wall is broken only by the large, gothic stylized cross hanging in
the perfect center.  The ceiling is a vaulted dome in dully glittering onyx
mosiac, and from it suspends a simple Victorian chandelier, offering gentle,
soothing light to those beneath it.  The acoustics in the chapel cause even
the slightest of muted whispers to carry from the pulpit to the rear exit,
which ends in polished, cherry-wood double doors.

`bViewing room at Eight Days of Luke Mortuary`n~
Through the delicately crafted, lattice-iron doors lies a narrow
rectangular room, panelled in the same dark cherry-wood as the lobby.  The
seating is stationary and arranged in a meticulous half-circle, facing away
from the entrance in plush sable velvet chairs with gold fastenings.  The
obvious focal point of the room is an open area with a raised dais, upon
which the recently deceased are lain within coffins for viewing, be they
open or closed casket.  Small, polished tables with round tops are arranged
in clusters, often holding framed photographs or other memorabilia chosen to
represent the life of the departed.  A slightly raised stage with a podium
lies behind the casket dais, allowing those who wish to say a few words on
the deceased a vantage point to look across both the coffin and the gathered
crowd.  Tall, thick circular candles in varying shades of dark blue are
sparsely arranged, providing just enough light to be able to see without
overexposing the dank pallor of the enclosed body.

`bPreparation room at Eight Days of Luke Mortuary`n~
The well-lit, white clinical appearance of this room serves to nearly
strip away the reality of the macabre trade practiced within the pale ivory
tiled walls.  Stainless steel tables stand at the center of the similarly
tiled floor, with drains installed strategically around and beneath them.  A
large embalming machine trails cords and hoses throughout the room, placed
upon a wheeled table to allow for movement from client to client.  A second
rolling table is laden with the tools of the trade, placed close to the
embalming machine.  The left wall is dominated by a large crematory furnace
and the oven control panel.  Along the right wall lies an array of cabinets
and a large, deep steel sink.  A simple burnished steel door to the east is
marked clearly with a sign reading 'Private,' and the back wall is
honeycomed with slide-out morgue lockers, each requiring a punched in
passcode to access, and a card labelled with a status - empty - or a name.

This is a dark space, accessible only through a clean room air-lock,
apparantly some kind of former laboratory, if one judges by the various,
empty glass beakers and vials adorning burnished steel shelves that line two
of the four walls.  A trio of stainless steel tables, similar to those found
in the room to the north, lie at the direct center of the ivory tiled floor,
and atop each is a polished ebony coffin, their ability to open and close
being staunched entirely by massive, locking steel clamps, no less than two
being clipped to each casket.  The door to the north requires a passcode to
open from this side, punched into a wall keypad with a pale blue backlight.

An old, creaky wooden stairwell that smells lightly of must and damp
leads to a trap door in the ceiling, which opens onto this brisk portion of
accessible roof space.  The ground is sprinkled sparsely with pepper colored
gravel, causing footfalls to grind audibly against the grey cement.  The
rooftop is enclosed on three sides by chipped brick with a heavily rusted
fire-escape ladder on the fourth, and a massive vent in the roof itself
filters scentless warmth into often chilled night air, creating languid
bursts of visible steam.  Thick jasmine vines choke the sides of the
building below, overflowing onto the roof to suffocate the complex array of
pipes installed there.

Faint, musty odor of old tobacco and cheap liquor fills the air.  Tables
are arranged in an orderly fashion, with four chairs to each table.  The
tables have a thin layer of dust from non-use.  A long bar extends across
the back wall, shielding various liquors and drink mixes from public view. 
A dirty rag is left on the bar from what looks like an attempt to clean. 
Filthy, stained mugs and glasses are stacked in a tub at the far end of the
bar, waiting to be washed.  A few pool tables, with most of the felt
missing, are placed on one side of the room.  The balls however, are not
missing like normal bars of this type, they are chipped and worn from over
use and poor care.  A soft fluorescent glow comes from the ceiling where a
few lights illuminate the room just enough so that a customer does not walk
into a table.

are tables to play cards in relative peace, with burgundy velvet chairs
ringing the sides opposite top-end dealers.  A smattering of slot machines
form a half-circle on one side of the room, with bar service and a full
cocktail menu available with but a gesture.  An entire wall is dominated by
massive windows that look over the French Quarter, revealing a grid of
sparkling lights and cars that appear tiny on the streets below.  Booths are
fitted against the windows, providing plush seats and gorgeous wood tables. 
Doors to private rooms lead off in all directions, and an elevator takes

notebooks full of childish drawings and sheet music all over the place - and
thats just the desk.  The west and north walls are lined with bookshelves. 
One is full of books - fiction, nonfiction, fantasy and religious texts,
some of them in Latin.  The bookshelf to the north has absolutely nothing in
it...  Nothing at all.  The wall to the south has a futon upon it for any
possible guests, also providing a nice reading spot.  The room is dim when
lit, and it also seems to be the smoking-room, from the occasional ashtray
and the faint smell of tobacco.

dust.  In the center of the room is a line of five old style dentist chairs
all well kept and clean.  There are two sets of shelves in the room with
bottles of ink and vacuum sealed needles.  On a counter near the tattoo area
is an industrial sterilizer with a couple rock band stickers stuck on it. 
On the walls are band posters and movie posters all brightly colored and
somewhat offensive.

#eOffice at the Black Lotus#n~
A small room with a plain metal desk off to the side.  Behind the desk is
a wooden door that has smoky glass with the words -No admittance- on it.  On
the walls around the desk are multiple framed certificates.  In the corner
are two large file cabinets with all kinds of magnets.

#eYori's Loft over the Black Lotus#n~
The room is massive and decorated with an Oriental hard rocker theme. 
The walls are plastered with band posters and shelves with assorted nick
knacks.  Off to one side is the living area with a decent sized television
and a leather couch and love seat.  On either side of the television are
large speakers that are conveniently connected to the large stereo in a case
off to the left.  Filling multiple shelves above the entertainment setup are
movies and cds of all sorts.  Behind the living area is the bedroom area
cornered off by rice paper screens and a couple curtains.  The bed is large
and unmade with a large oriental rug under it.  Along the side of the bed is
a large bookshelf that is full of books and magazines.  Off to the right of
the bedroom is the kitchen area which is somewhat plain compared to the rest
of the loft.  The only thing that makes it stand out a bit is the old
refrigerator that is covered in band stickers.

#eA #wS#eculpted #wG#earden and #wD#eriveway#n~
Paved with blackish stones, a straight driveway connects Prytania Street
to the sprawling front garden of an old stately bungalow, the driveway's
vein severed by a set of tall iron gates.  The portico of the French styled
home is littered with dead twigs and dried leaves, endearing to it a wild
and rustic countryside temperament.  Black sedans belonging to the
inhabitants are parked in the garage to the left, the folding doors half
hidden by the groaning branches of pale olive weeping willows growing next
to it.  Dark green carpet grass cover parts of the lawn which are not
criss-crossed by pathways under old hoary cypresses.  Rose of Sharon bushes
lie thickly, dotting most of the landscape; the ivory and pink blooms tended
by loving hands.  White ceramic tiled steps covered with more dead leaves
lead up to a flat porch, the roof supported by two weather-beaten pillars. 
A set of heavy wooden doors, painted soft black, allow entrance into the
bungalow, knobs shaped like Venetian winged lions affixed on the doors
themselves.

#eA #wL#eavish and #wC#eomfortable #wP#earlor#n~
Long couches of a dark matte gold striped with cream and generously
littered with ivory pillows, each patterned with black monograms, are
arranged in a circular fashion around an antique rectangular cherrywood
table.  The parlor boasts walls covered with hand-painted Italian frescoes,
mostly religious and mythical in bearing.  Archaic wooden doors barricade
each side, leading to other rooms in the bungalow.  Tall, oak-panelled
pillars stand at each corner of the room, wall-lights wrought of twisted
copper and fluted glass attached to each one of them.  A mahogany bar with
accompanying cushioned stools serves as an oasis, providing a modest
selection of liquors and cult wines for the inhabitants.  Wood cut prints
and oil paintings of the Mediterranean cover the walls, notably present in
these artistic themes is that of Venice.

`eAn `CO`cutdoor `CP`cool`w B`eehind a`w G`earden`w D`eistrict `wE`estate`n~
Roomd High-backed lounge chairs made of outdoor stained wicker sit around
a large kidney-shaped pool filled with clear, crisp blue water.  The deepest
end is twelve feet, and the shallowest is four; cyan tiles cover the entire
basin, and the pool edge is antiqued terra cotta.  Tropical plants with
broad, dark leaves surround the body of water, the most dense around the
decorative waterfall that bubbles out of an underground pump and flows down
white rock into the pool.  An eave of dark wood lattice juts over the back
door of the estate, crawling with fragrant jasmine that chokes out the
sunlight by day and makes the darkness impenetrable by night.  There are
three identical red sunning chairs beside the pool, arranged in perfectly
straight parallels with teak drink tables between them.  The fence
surrounding the backyard spans wide, enclosing about three yards of space
without the pool and surrounding areas included.  Plastic misters hang from
the lattice awning, and a little outdoor fridge sits against the porch wall,
holding only champagne, icy flute glasses and bottled white teas.

Smooth, Indian cotton sheets stretch over a king-sized bed set in an
ornate four poster frame layered with flimsy gauzing by the sides.  The
offering of pillows and cushions is generous upon the bed and the floor is
covered with a luxurious rich-red wall to wall carpet.  The bedroom comes
equipped with an attached bathroom, seperated by a small door.  A vanity and
an accompanying working desk is provided for the room's occupant.  The walls
are decorated with paintings of the Sicilian coast and a teak bookshelf
contains a collection of classic Italian literature.  Heavy drapes of
crimson chenille cover windows already blinded with black blinds, preventing
any insight into the privacy of the bedroom.

A perfectly smooth, broad expanse of light grey cement winds toward a
massive old fashioned house from a pair of electronically guided, curling
iron-cast gates with tiny security cameras mounted high atop elegant white
pillars on either side.  A keypad can be seen installed upon the right
pillar, allowing persons to type in a passcode or press a singular marked
blue button and speak into a circular, hidden behind a textured metallic
plate, both of which have been affixed within the very plaster and marble of
the cylindrical post.

`wCourtyard and Fountain`n~
A large plantation style house rises out of the bustle of the Garden
District, bearing a wrap-around, elegant porch with four white columns
framing the opaque, frosted-glass paned french doors that lead inward. 
There are no windows visible on the exterior of the old white-washed house,
but on the second story five bay windows are evenly spaced across the front
wall.  The house bears a border painted an earthy crimson red, but green
drapes of heavy choking Spanish moss and vines of curling jasmine add a
wild, unusually aesthetic visual texture.  The perfectly smooth cement
driveway forms a circle around a large black marble fountain with several
dozen gem-like white coy with brilliant splotches of red on their backs and
fins padding softly within it, allowing vehicles to turn around or park
without difficulty.  A large detatched garage that could easily store four
vehicles has been erected to the west.

`wMain Room`n~
This moderately sized, dimly lit room is furnished by several deep
scarlet suede couches.  The couches form a half-circle around a long
glass-topped cherrywood table with subtle filligree on the outer legs.  The
ceiling is high and vaulted with a perfectly circular crystal chandelier
hanging from the exposed beams, electrically lit with small faux-candles
with a dial on the wall to increase or decrease the illumination as desired.
Various paintings in dark hues and religious or macabre themes hang upon the
walls, each framed within hard, almost black wood.  The entire ceiling from
one side to the other is lined completely in mirrors.  Wooden steps polished
to a mirror-like shine lead onto a small landing to the south, ending in a
pair of carved french doors with opaque, frosted glass panels.  A similar
pair of doors border the western wall, locked solidly.  To the north is the
exit, edged with thick cream colored crown moulding.  A spiraling polished
wood staircase with smooth crimson runners circles up through the ceiling
onto the second floor.

The inside of this garage looks more like a warehouse than an actual

against the walls.  The smell of oil and gasoline is thick in the stale air,
and there appears to be space for approximately four good sized vehicles. 
There are no windows whatsoever, and each of the four designated parking
places opens with it's own mechanism and raising metallic door.

A large cherrywood boardroom styled table sits directly in the middle of
this long, rectangular room, with eleven massive office chairs upholstered
in rouge suede situated on all sides but the foot.  From the ceiling
descends a perfectly circular crystal-dropped chandelier with polished
sterling holders and faux candles in the stead of simple, less aesthetic
electrical bulbs, and the entire ceiling is lined in mirrors from one side
to the other.  A full, clean illumination is cast down across the table and
the contents, along with any occupants of the room.  The walls are set with
thick, dark cherry-stained crown-moulding at the waist level, and
brilliantly crimson texturing from there to the ceiling, with a pulldown
white-screen behind the head of the table, several maps of the city from
different points of view -- the sewer web, rooftop vantage points and a
simple outline of each street with complete dissection of the complicated
French Quarter.  The eastern wall bears a massive, thick door of solid steel
with a touchpad for a Biometric fingerprint reader.  A tiny camera mounted
in the ceiling pans directly at the floor before the touchpad.

`rVilmos Private Investigations - Reception`n~
Upon entering through the heavy wooden door one is immediately presented
with a stark lighting adjustment from the fluorescent lighting of the
hallway to a much more dim, sparsely-lit room lit by four small wall-laps
(one on each wall) and a dim, shaded ceiling bulb.  The room itself is
fairly large, decked in a dark oak floor which melds suitably with skirting
boards of equal hue.  The walls are a mix of two colours split by a dark oak
wooden border.  The bottom half is a dark bottle green while the upper is a
pale cream which also covers the ceiling.  There are two hard-looking black
leather sofas on opposite sides of the room with a decent-sized coffee table
between them holding one or two magazines, a newspaper and two ashtrays. 
Little else is within the room save for a aesthetic potted fern, a water
cooler and a ceiling fan, which rotates at a low hum.  The northern wall has
a heavy-looking wooden door with a brass plaque which reads; Office of
Theodore Vilmos.

`rOffice of Theodore Vilmos`n~
When entering this office one would again be struck by a lighting change,
this room being even dimmer than the mood-lit waiting room, lit only by a
desk-lamp, two wall-lamps and the irregular glow of the outside streetlamp,
casting shadows from everything in sight.  The office is no larger in size
in comparison to the waiting area, yet with the addition of the window one
could easily mistake it for being larger.  The floor is again dark oak;
however the walls of this room are all of one colour, all being a pale cream
which serves to give some hope of light to the dim space.  The walls are
sparsely decorated with one or two framed certificates and a large round
clock which gives a rhythmic tick once per second.  A large, heavy desk
stands proud in the corner opposite the door with a comfortable, soft chair
behind it and two less-comfortable looking chairs before it.  The desk
houses the usual array of supplies; a brass lamp a with bottle-green glass
shade, various stationary, papers, an open book, a telephone complete with a
ring-dial and of course a very full ashtray.  Two other furnishings of note
would be the sturdy gray filing cabinet sitting in one corner and the large,
proud-looking bookcase not too far from it.  A plain iron and wood slatted
staircase is enclosed by plaster walls, leading up into a well in the
ceiling.

are painted a vibrant yellow to make the room seem larger.  A plush,
comfortable couch is pushed up against the wall, it's backside against a
window.  Large, seemingly comfortable lounge chairs are placed strategically
around the room, for optimal viewing of the large entertainment system.  The
television seems new, and is quite large for most standards, while the
surround sound speakers are placed in every corner of the room.  A large
stands of movies is placed against the entertainment system.  A large
bookcase takes up most of one wall, holding all sorts of various books.  The
end tables are scattered with magazines, and the occasional ashtray can be
found.

eminated from the kitchen to the north and a low sound of music comes from
the bedroom upstairs.  Voices echo from the hallway to the west of you. 
It's rather chilly in the room.

with blankets and pillows, looking freshly made.  On the wall above the bed
is a long shelt in which many trophies and awards of different types are
placed.  Next to the bed, on the desk, is a small laptop computer, a
telephone, and several notebooks for late night studying, homework, or
online fun.  Large windows allow in a massive amount of light, making this
room seem alive.

scattered across it, sits just directly from the bathtub.  A soft plush rug
sits between the two, on the floor, to help soak up any dripped water.  A
toilet is in the corner, seeming small and hidden compared to the rest of
the house.

or another cheaper well-established furniture company.  The kitchen contains
everything a good kitchen should contain; A rather large set of knives, a
refrigirator, an oven and alot of other useful tools for cooking.  A set of
chairs and a table take up most of the free area in the room.  Heat eminates
from a radiator below a window facing to the west.  The walls are painted
white and the floor is composed of black and white tile.  To the south, the
faint sounds of a TV can be heard.

line the wall to the north.  A window to the south grants one a good view
over dauphin street.  A few computer games scrap on the floor, piled up in a
cuple of small heaps of discs and boxes.  It's rather warm in the room, a
good deal of the heat comes from a radiator below the window.  To the east
lies the bathroom and down the staircase is the livingroom.

The restricted area continues on past the nightclub portion of the
Dungeon.  From the looks on things, this could quite possibly be part of the
original portion of the building.  Flagstones have been laid for the path
and the coolness from the stone walls causes the whole hallway to be at
least ten degrees cooler than the nightclub.  A few short wooden doors line
the hallway as it continues on and around the corner.

As the hallway ends, this portion is easily noticed to be very modern. 
What looks to be a flattened portion of the wall to the north actually can
be made out as a very high tech modern sliding door.  Two massive looking
security guards stand watch at the entrance, both dressed in the same
security fashion with small earpieces placed within their ear.  A camera
above the door pans the small distance of the entrance.  Just to the south,
what looks to be a large bay loading door fits flush against the wall.

chat about the ongoing events throughout the world.  Large paintings of the
local area have been placed upon the walls and the only modern items within
the room are placed in the far corner.  A small corner style desk with
several computer monitors are all crammed together.  A large flat screen
television hangs just over the desk and overall all the modern electronics
gives off a light hum throughout the room.  Upon one of the screens looks to
be the standard security of the nightclub, another has the outside of the
Elysium and another seems to have stats and figures that scrolls nonstop.

much smaller, with only a conference table and large plush chairs for

look to be the best living conditions compared to the rest of the French
Quarter.  Small black letters hang upon each door giving the address of the
apartment.

#rApartment C - Main Room#n~
This appears to be a pretty standard 18 by 15 studio apartment.  When you
first walk into the room you immediately see another door, which leads to
the bath room.  On the outside of this Door are a few hooks for hanging
stuff on.  These hooks hold at least a single security guard uniform at any
given time.  A large Bead curtain attempts to partition off this hallway
from the rest of the house.  The only things that exist to reinforce the
illusion of this actually being a hallway is the abrupt ending of the cheap
Berber carpet, and a small pony wall immediately right next to the door,
after about 4 feet though the pony wall ends.  To the right is a large walk
in closet, with sliding doors.  This closet is a pantry, a closet, and
storage space all in one.  On the out side of each door sits a large mirror
facing the rest of the room.  To the left is the entirety of the rest of the
apartment; Bedroom, kitchen and living room all in one.  On the other side
of the pony wall, is a small 20 inch TV.  The wall, opposite the closets
holds the single window in the apartment, which is covered by thick
curtains.  Directly beneath the window is a rather large Futon.  Running
along the wall that houses the bathroom door is the kitchen counter top, and
stove.  A single computer, which is probably one of the few antiques in the
apartment, sits on this counter top, as well as a number of cupboards, for
storing food and dishes and such.  The refrigerator separates the bathroom
door area from the kitchen countertop (thank god.)  .  The wall opposite the
kitchen has a few wall scrolls dedicated to Soul Caliber 2, and a couple
various animes.  A single alarm clock and rubber made container sit
next/under the futon.

`rApartment C - Bathroom`n~
This is a 5 by 12 room tiled almost complete in ceramic.  A medicine
cabinet, which appears to be incapable of being closed all the way, is
partially open.  Insulin, needles, and other such drug paraphernalia lay
inside.  A single cupboard over the toilet is the bath room closet, which
has all the standard toiletries of a bathroom.  The rest of the bathroom is
filled with a shower, which has a thick glass door, which can lock in steam
when showering.

#rApartment D - Small Well Furnished Apartment#n~
Eggshell white paint seems to cover every inch of this quaint New Orleans
apartment, giving it a characteristically neutral look.  A few off white
pleather armchairs sit facing a large, albeit slightly old television which
hums ominously in the corner.  On the other side of the room, a queen sized
bed sits, seemingly unused and unwanted, the sheets still having creases
from where they were folded before being put on.  The south wall of the
apartment is mirrored, giving the illusion of space in what otherwise would
look to be a rather small, one room apartment.

`e-=`gEntrance to Club Atropin`e=-`n~
#eThis room is fairly large, and is lavishly decorated in smoky hues of
black, grey and green.  The walls are lined from ceiling to floor with black
velvet, and small conces of opaque viridian glass are fixed in place through
the fabric every few feet, providing the room with an unnatural green light.
A large door with live, tropical vines twisting around the frame is on the
western end of the room, and on each side are two huge men, dressed in
matching uniforms of black with a small green symbol on the back.  Among the
crowd of people in the main of the room are several more of the huge guards,
attempting to blend in as best they can with the crowds of vinyl and leather
clad patrons.  Darkly themed tapestries line the walls here and there, and
several carnivorous plants with huge, flat leaves are placed in black
ceramic pots throughout the room.  Chains hang from the rafters and drape
across the whole of the building, dangling everything from old fashioned
iron padlocks to cloyingly sweet smelling flowering vines over the heads of
the patrons.  #n

lined from ceiling to floor with black velvet, and small sconces of opaque 
viridian glass are fixed in place through the fabric every few feet, 
providing the room with an unnatural green glow.  A gigantic venus fly trap 
has been placed at the southern end of the bar, and several species of live

#rA Large Bedroom#n~
This bedroom is nothing extraordinary, and seems to encompass the
sterotype of a hotel room.  There is a single bed with dark burgandy sheets,
a mahogany nightstand and dresser, and a desk within.  The only exception to
the standardized setting of this room is outdated computer atop the wooden
desk.  It appears to be a model from the mid-nineties, and functions on
Windows 95.  Other than this, the dark walls and flooring give the bedroom a
slight eerie cast.  A closet is seen just adjacent to the bed, and is filled
with men's attire ranging from formal to informal.  Decorations are even
more sparse, and the most eye-catching thing is a wallet-sized picture atop
the nightstand that showcases a rather deranged looking specimen of
humanity.  The man in the picture is haggard and suffering from worse than a
bad hair day.  The details are hard to make out, however, for the picture is
rather fuzzy.

of the room a small circular shelf with a few books is adorned with even
more of the wax cylinders.  Small cushions are placed on the floor all
around and dark wood shelves line the walls, more books are arranged on
them.  Written above them on the walls are the genre they belong to.  The
smell of incense is heavy in this room.

Against one wall is a counter with a cash register, surrounded by small
containers of pens, pencils, bookmarks, and other small and sundry items. 
To the south, is a room containing more books, a coffee bar, and a seating
area.

Exiting Dauphin Street has brought you through the twin doors of glass
and into something that would appear to be a computer repair shop, or at
least that is what the signs on the outside and inside would have you to
believe.  The walls of both the left and right side of this place are lined
with any number of desks and shelves, and all of those have become cluttered
with an assortment of various parts and pieces that are for sale, and even a
few computers that are whole and put together, ready to be used and
glimmering beneath the bright track-lighting that runs the entire length of
the shop's ceiling.  To the north is another counter with a door behind it,
and this one is scattered with mechanical and electrical pieces of this or
that.  All in all, there seems to be little about this place to make it
stand out from any other places of it's ilk.  Hanging on the wall behind the
counter are an array of certificates and degrees from a collection of
schools and classes, including a few newspaper articles, each featuring the
same person within.  In the corner of the room, a small camera pans back and
forth, very slowly.

#eAn Old Sewer Control Station#n~
This is a rundown entrance to the French Quarter sewer system.  This room
looks like it was once used as a control point to run various parts of the
system, but now it just seems abandoned.  The smell of the sewer still seeps
through a small pipe just large enough for a person to crawl through and for
the sewer rats to run in and out.  Another pipe, which is a lot smaller,
allowed drainage to escape to the Mississippi River.  The wisest exit would
be back up the ladder to the boardwalk, though crawling through the tunnel
north is a distinct possibility. To the south is a solid steel, absolutely
filthy door with wagon-wheel sized turnicate style bolt. It would take 
insane strength to be able to open the door.

Two large doors open for the entrance to Isis.  Before them, a bouncer is
checking everyones ID's, as they move to the booth to pay cover.  The walls
are dark limestone, with vines sprawling out all over them.  Palm trees line
the walls and the entrance to the club.  The lighting is dark, with a blue
hint to it.  The air is cool, with just a touch of dampness.  Mist can be
seen covering the floor from the entrance to the club as the loud bass from
the music fills the room.  The bouncer is dressed in somewhat Egyptian garb,
with loincloths and armlets made of gold.  The woman taking cover is dressed
in a white silk robe, her makeup ornate and egyptian looking.  Past lays the
large stone entries to the club.

area, as mist covers the entire floor.  In the center of this area is a cage
suspended from the ceiling, made of vines, with a woman dressed in Egyptian
tribal clothing, raving in it.  Over against the far wall lies the bar.  The
entire front of the bar is a big aquarium with large exotic fish in it.  The
bartender is dressed in a white loincloth and has gold body paint all over
him.  The drinks he makes, seem to be on the exotic end.  The lighting is a
bluish-green, dark enough to give it a night effect.

covered walls.  Through the center of the dancefloor brilliant blue water
flows under a fiberglass covered creek bed.  In the middle of the
dancefloor, a large pedestal is occupied by a woman dressed in jungle tribal
clothing, raving with fire batons.  A thick mist fills the entire area as
the loud thumping of techno and dance music fill the room.  A few vine cages
are suspended from the ceiling with a dancer in each.  At the back wall is
what looks like to be a Sphinx's head, but where the mouth should be is the
DJ booth, with the DJ spinning.

the apartment lays a rod-iron desk with a glass top.  The desk is rectangle
shape and has files scattered all over it, with a laptop in the direct
center.  Behind that is a one-sided mirror window that looks down on the
club.  Laying in the direct center of the living room are a pair of two
black leather couches with a glass top, rod iron coffee table in between. 
On the wall to the side of the couches lays an entertainment system, with
stereo, tv and all.  The lighting is delivered through numerous ceiling
lights, and interesting looking floor lamps.  At the back of the apartment

`rA one-room apartment`n~
The ceiling in this room is canted on either side, a strip in the middle
a few feet wide being the only vertical section.  The walls themselves also
curve, lending the whole room a tent-like look, covered with an old, peeling
dark wallpaper with dingy, moist plaster behind it from a century of leaking
rainwater and humidity.  An old hanging lamp with a thick, age-yellowed
glass bulb descends from the center of the ceiling, casting its dim glow
onto the rough wood floor.  The room as a whole is spartanly furnished; in
the right hand corner is a futon-like sofa with a generic black cushion,
flush against the wall.  An acoustic sound barrier is against the far wall,
keeping the noise of both the neighbors and the occupant to a minimum.  The
left hand wall has a small, antique burnished table with two matching
chairs.  Pieces of cheap, aluminum-framed bedroom furniture have been
carefully placed, a set of bunk-beds lined with black cotton sheets rises
from the floor, messily made up with a single hand-quilted blanket and pair
of soft pillows on the upper bunk.  The wood floor is obviously well taken
care of but shows tell-tale signs of the wear and tear typically present in
decrepit old buildings.

Inquisitors on Bourbon and Blood are run by rules based around the Dark

Catholic church, that to this day, still operates to protect the flock from
the tendrils of the Adversary.  The Inquisitors in this day and age,
however, are not armed with swords and crosses, but rather guns and their
wits.  They strive to defend those who can not defend themselves, while
remaining hidden from the prying eyes of Demons and the clutches of the
secular authorities.  Unlike Inquisitors in the past, they can not use the

predators that stalk the deepest woods and the darkest urban alleyways. 
Monsters that creep up on their prey like ghosts, then explode into a fury
of claws and fangs.  Beasts that howl under the full moon and kill those
that cross the boundaries of their territory.  They are often refered to as
Werewolves.  The chosen warriors of Gaia to defend Her against the taint
that has started to spread so far.  Given Gifts from the great spirits and
forms beyond all imagining, they battle the Wyrm taint, wherever and
whenever it breeds, protecting their Mother till the last breath escapes
their lungs.  Split into different Tribes because of their nature and
guiding spirits, they fight for dominion, but when battle arises, nothing
stands in their way.

#eMortal Classing Room#n~
So you want to be a mortal?  Unlike many places that practically shun you
if you decide to just roleplay a mortal, here at Bourbon and Blood, we
actually encourage it, especially if this is your first experience with the
White Wolf systems.  As a mortal, you get #cfive points to distribute to your
Virtues#n, type #chelp virtues#n to get a better understanding of what they
are.  You also get #cfive points#n to distribute for Backgrounds.  #cHelp
backgrounds#n gives a list of different backgrounds that are available.  Most
mortals invest points into resources, allies and contacts.  As a mortal, one
of the advantages is that you get #c21 Freebie points#n, #chelp freebie#n gives
you a list of how much each thing costs.  Each mortal has their own
background story that tells about them and pretty much makes them who
they are.  Please go to the mortal application page on our website and
fill in the different sections of the application.  
 
#BThe Mortal Application can be found here: http://twilightmu.org/bnbmortalback.php#n
 
#oDo not send tells directly to ST's or staff, unless asked to by
them in a specific instance.  Use 'request' channel.#n

#rA small bedroom#n~
A double bed takes up the majority of space in this room.  There is a
small window opening up to the east giving a view of the next building and
the small alley between them.  A closet is set on the north side of the
room, and a dresser and night table take up what space is left.

#rA small bathroom#n~
This is a small bathroom, complete with sink, mirror and medicine
cabinet, toilet, a very small bathtub and shower.  Its small enough not to
have any windows at all.  If you've seen one apartment bathroom you've seen
them all.

`pA living room and bedroom`n~
Entering through the standard wooden door, vividly deep shades of purple
greet the eye.  This entire small loft styled room is coated in a dusky plum
tone, causing the battered dark wooden floors to almost blend in, creating a
seamless effect.  Catching the light at just the right angle medallion sized
gold stampings in the stylized shapes of a moon eclipsed sun and patterned
stars can be seen giving off a faint shimmer.  On the far side of the room
next to the arching windows, dressed in dusky velvets, rests an art nouveau
revival sofa with gilt legs, plumped high with various pillows in muted
jewel tones.  Just off to the side is settled an oversized footstool with a
gilt sculpted wood base, also nouveau in its make, a wooden tray in a dark
toned rests on top of it offering a place to set drinks and such.  Set just
across from the couch is a gondola settee, done after the style of Sue et
Mare, its seat covered by a plush faux fur throw and single plump pillow. 
The entire living area seems to harken back to the gilt and glam days of the
1920s, with a large wooden screen used to denote the move from living area
to bedroom in a smooth transition of style and color.  A queen sized four
poster bed is draped in a sheer gauzy fabric in an effort to gain a bit of
privacy, the bed itself is piled high with a disordered pile of several
pillows and a comforter in rich green tones.  An armoire banks the wall left
of the bed, a place to store clothes and linen, its style simple and clean
in line.  Against the wall furthest from the windows is the kitchen, painted
in the same manner as the rest of the loft the standard make and layout of
the appliances and glass fronted cabinets offers no real interest.  A simple
bathroom not much larger than a closet is tucked through a draped doorway to
the right, offering a standing shower and a cluttered counter and sink.  A
single arched doorway leads off of the room.

`pA large backroom studio`n~
This may have at one time been a large bedroom but the carpet has been
stripped away to leave the hard wood floor bare.  Unlike the last room these
walls are left a stark white with the exception of a single brick wall
hosting several windows.  The other three walls are wrapped in floor to
ceiling mirrors, offering reflection upon reflection to the eye.  A long
wood railing runs the full length of the mirrored walls at waist height in a
style often seen in ballet studios.  A cheap surround-sound system shows
high up on the walls the speakers done in the same muted white as the walls,
the sound system itself hosted in a dark wooden cabinet in between of two of
the arching windows.  The single closet of the room is host to several sets
of ballet shoes and informal athletic clothes.  On the uppermost shelf is a
box of plaques covered in dust, as if long forgotten.  A pair of wooden
stools are tucked in beside the closet with a small refrigerator nestled
between them, to the left of the first stool is a small pan containing a
towel and half used container of Epsom salts.  A tall cd rack contains
mostly classical recital music, fitting to ballet, though a small amount of
older rock and early 90s alternative is piled off to the side.  A dark blue
curtian blocks off the next room from view, the only way out of the studio.

`pAn unused, dusty shrine`n~
This closet sized room perhaps served as a small bedroom at one time, its
wall and ceiling painted a gentle blue depiction of stormy skies and open
raging seas.  The open doorway is blocked off by a heavy drape in a dark
blue tone.  Several pillows litter the hard wood floor, offering places to
sit and relax.  A mid-sized water fountain of natural rock trickles in a
peaceful patter placed against the wall furthest from the door, settled in
front of the rooms only window.  Two low tables covered in deep blue cloth
flank each side of the fountain.  The first table holding a small Lasa
Shrine, and offerings of nectar, fava beans and grain in small earthenware
bowls with a set of three white candles placed around it in silver holders. 
The second table holds another set of three candles, all white, an aged
Cimaruta on a twisted silver chain and the representation of the four
elemental corners.  A small cherry wood wand is placed facing east to
represent aerial, an Athame in the south to symbolize fire, a chalice to the
west for water, and a Boline to symbolize terrestrial to the north.  The
upper left side of the alter holds a small ivory statue depicting Diana with
a small offering of moonstones below it, while the upper right corner holds
a wooden depiction of Lucifer, a small offering of acorns below it..  A
pillow made for kneeling rests directly before each of the tables.

#GUpon the Lake Front#n~
Sweetgum and hackberry saplings take root just past the shoulder of the 
road, offering an unobstructed view to the sprawling murky lake beyond, 
its pebbled shoreline thickening briefly here as the trees thin away. The 
lined asphalt curves close, separated by just a scant smattering of 
vegetation and struggling saplings, the landscape showing heavy signs of 
renovation and progress though natures still seems to have a small tenuous 
grasp on the land. The cries of egrets and heron drifting upon the wind, 
carrying an almost mournful song against the murky surface of the lake 
ebbing along the time smoothed pebbles of the shore. Just down the shore 
line dot of green and black can be made out, giving color to the otherwise 
muted stretch.

#GUpon the Lake Front#n~
Gentle breezes rustle in from the murky surface of the lake. In the 
distance boats bob with the lapping of the water against their hull, 
moored along the marina piers in tight neat rows, a few lit and alive 
with the sounds of people and music. Trees old and youthful alike grow 
sparse, cleared away to allow access to the pebbled shore line beyond, 
several well tended picnic tables lingering here and there among the 
occasional azalea blooms. Large metal grills stand out in stark contrast
 to the natural surroundings, offering a chance for bbqs or the late 
night roasting of marshmallows. Rising up from skyline a large building 
rests silhouetted at a distance by a healthy growth of old cypress and 
oaks draped with moss, a few lights dotting the face of it to show signs 
of life. The squat buildings of the Marina and the bleak black expanse 
of the well lit parking lot await just a bit further along, giving a 
home to the cars and trailers of those enjoying the lakes delights.

#GThe Marina Upon the Lake Front#n~
Stout white clad buildings stand out in firm contrast against the gray 
of the lake water and the deep black of the parking lot dotted with all 
make and model of transpiration and trailer for toting both boat and 
people to and from the pebbled shores. Long piers of wood and metal cut 
dark stark lines against the ever moving surface of the murky lake, 
several boats moored there at any given time, alive with the sounds of 
people and music. Sweet Olive trees draped in climbing Carolina jasmine 
and wisteria have been planted in strategic places in an attempt to draw 
a bit of nature back to the area, lending a gentle flowery scent to the 
wind. Low green benches of painted wood rest on a small strip of 
struggling grass that marks the transition from lake short to parking 
lot, offering an unobstructed view for those so inclined to linger and 
take in the pleasant view offered. Just to the west, banked against a 
large cropping of cypress and live oaks draped in moss resides an 
imposing complex of condos, a few lights dotting the face of it to show 
signs of life. Geese, swans and ducks cruise the shore line near the 
benches, rushing ashore at the slightest hint of bread or seed, often 
offered by those who frequent the area.

#oThe Sewers#n~
The sewer system is nothing more than a series of pipes, darkness, human
feces, vomit and just about anything else that washes down from the streets
and the toilets of New Orleans.  Without a light, one would only be able to
find their way through the filth by slowly slithering their way along.  Even
with a light, the glow doesn't extend far, the only other reflection coming
from the occasional rat that squeaks as it jets past in search of food. 
Occasionally the pipes branch off in various directions as incoming fluids
flow southward.

#oThe Sewers#n~
The sewer's passage has become impossible after this point.  The catwalk
has broken off, collapsed, and took much of the sewer walls with it,
creating an impassible barricade of concrete and jagged debris, fit only for
the leaking of water in small streams.  Anyone attempting to move west will
need to find a new route.  Luckily, a dilapidated ladder against the sewer
wall leads upwards, and looks as if it might hold a person's weight.

#oUnder the Mausoleum#n~
This small stone room is rather damp and dirty, though it's not too bad
considering its underground in New Orleans and adjacent to the pipes of the
sewer system.  The pipe looks just small enough for a person to crawl into,
though who would want to is another question.  Stone steps lead up to an old
rusted iron door that looks as if it hasn't been open in many years.  This
room must be used for storage for caskets after the bodies have been removed
from them so that the rest of the family may be placed into the tomb too. 
Crazed drawings of skeletons and demonic figures appear on the walls as if
some local punks or voodoo fanatics have claimed this as one of their secret
nightly ritual spots.

#rA Small Apartment Complex#n~
After coming up the stairs from the first floor it is easy to notice that
this place is a lot larger than it looks from the outside.  Tile fills the
whole of the floor, from door to door.  Each heavyweight wooden door has a
small letter in black, giving the address of the apartment. A security pad
with blue illuminated numbers is mounted on the door to the east.

`rThe Main Room`n~
The door creaks open into a wisp of steam from a wheezing radiator to the
right, the low, weary whistle melody to the sluggish rhythm of the ceiling
fan up above.  The air is thick and moist, slowly carrying the faint scents
of rot, age, and dust on the frail winds from the fan around the room.  The
floor is of wooden planks, stained with matter of all shape and hue; the
walls of the room are adorned with pieces of writing, discernable among them
are old newspapers, pages from obscure books, and the occasional bible
passage, torn right from the book itself.  Two windows sit in the far end of
the wall, the cheap blinds covering the black paint hastily spread across
the glass while old, wooden doors facet the center of the other walls. 
Several creaky, rusted, metal fold-up chairs lay randomly around the
otherwise empty room, save the corner, where several papers sit calmly on a
wooden crate, and an out-dated television lies on the floor.  A simple
mattress adorned with plain white sheets, a couple pillows, and a Hello
Kitty comforter sits on the floor in a corner, out of the way.

This room is almost as large as the main room, though not nearly as
empty.  Kicked off to the side of the room are a few articles of clothing, a
top hat, several messy piles of papers and books, and a lamp with a naked
light bulb, the only source of light.  A chair of the same style as the main
room rests on its side, as if kicked over, beneath a noose hanging ominously
from the ceiling in the exact middle of the room, daring onlookers to guess
why its there.

A white, porcelain bathtub sits against the wall about three steps into
the room, usually filled about half-way with carelessly butchered pieces of
flesh, torn from an unknown source, festering in a crimson soup.  A broken
mirror hangs above a rusted iron sink, similarly smeared with red in oddly
finger-shaped streaks, the sink, too, splattered in red.  The toilet, sans
seat, holds a host of gruesome hooks, chains, and a few jagged-looking
knives, settling in a cesspool of gore.  The floor and walls are covered in
tiles, some broken, some missing, most housing at least one bloodstain, the
ceiling a plain wood, a single bare bulb hanging from the center.

`rHallway`n~
Leading from the main room to a room at the end is a dark hallway.  From
what light that would leak in from either room, one would see the faint
outlines of vaguely humanoid forms decorating either side of the hallway,
some hanging from the ceiling, narrowing the path in which one has to walk. 
The forms do not move, whether they be watching, waiting, or neither. 
Dozens of manikins in various positions line the hallway, each in various
stages of destruction; some missing limbs, others eyes, others looking like
someone just plain decided to hack them up with a knife.  Likewise, a few
unlucky manikins hang from the ceiling by ropes and chains, those usually
the most mutilated.  The walls, themselves, are covered in writing, either
painted in a reddish, coppery paint or just carved right into the drywall.

#oA musty old tomb#n~
The constant dampness of the tomb does little to help the odors of mildew
and decay that linger inside it.  A few marble caskets line the walls.  Some
are serene, some are tampered with.  There is a rusted candleabra mounted in
the rear wall, with a bit of fresh wax dangling from the place a candle
should be.  Bones from the nearby tombs and coffins are lying on the floor
in positions fashioned after life - holding hands, scratching their heads,
even masturbating.  The western wall has been chiseled through, creating a
narrow tunnel into a neighboring crypt.

#oA small crypt#n~
It smells of mildew, but not as much as it smells like decay.  The
caskets in this crypt have all been desecrated.  The walls and ceiling,
aside from the tunneled entrance from the tomb to the east, are quite
literally covered in corpses.  Some are whole and mounted by wooden stakes
through their bodies, some are dismembered.  Some are putrid with death,
others are fresh.  Skulls and bones of the long dead are spread around the
crypt in an almost decorative fashion.  In the center of the crypt is a
single chair - a wooden rocker coated in peeling yellow paint.  Strange
noises seem to echo from the shadows.

This small studio apartment is nothing special.  A small single bed is
tucked in one corner of the room, the sheets and covers lay on the floor
next to it.  Atop the mattress various books lie open.  Tucked away in one
of the corners of the room, a computer is siting atop an oddly shaped
computer desk.  Scattered across the desk and around it are various pieces
of paper with scribbles on it.  Across from the bed a small color television
sits on a wire shelf.  Boxes of books take up most of the room within the
small Apartment.  The only walkways available, are one to his bed and one to
the bathroom.  Under the bed a small handle can be seen attached to the
floor.

#pArcadian Books & Prints, Basement Workshop#n~
This large, open space has obviously been set up for use as a workshop,
though it still somehow maintains an inviting appeal, a sense of cozy
warmth.  Oak shelves are stocked with innumerable supplies, both to restock
the shop out front and to craft many of the items found therein.  Metals,
gemstones and crystals, wax and wicks, oils and herbs and resins, all this
and more can be found neatly organized and within reach of their
corresponding tools and equipment.  A large work table stands near the
center of the room, fashioned to house a number of drawers for supplies and
tools.  Hardwood flooring is kept clean and polished, with additional
lighting beyond the ambient available for tasks that require such.  In one
corner, a canvas rests upon an easel facing the room, paints and brushes
standing ready nearby.  A pottery wheel is set up nearby, along with a small
kiln for firing the products finished upon it.  A small desk stands against
the wall to the right, neatly organized and allowing this room to serve as
an office, as well.  At the back, a set of stairs angles upwards to the shop
floor.

`wThe Living Room`n~
Upon entering this little apartment you notice that it has old dark hard
wood floors that have been worn soft and smooth with age.  Strewn across the
old floor space are cheerful colored throw rugs to help keep the dampness in
the winter of the floor and to cheer the room up a little more.  Like the
apartment its self most of the furniture in the room look to be well kept
hand me downs.  On the fare wall there is soft and well loved brown swayed
couch the looks to have grown over stuffed with years of use and next to it
in the corner is a light oak wooden end table with a medium sized Tiffany
style lamp resting on it with a few coasters.  Under the table though is
what appears to be large fluffy pink doggie pillow that is not obscured by a
small glass coffee table so that it too faces the modest TV and DVD sound
system.  On the coffee table though is a large vase that is always filled
with seasonal flower bouquets .  Behind the TV there is a little half wall
divided that give you a view of the kitchen that has various small kitchen
gadgets and a coffee maker that almost always seems to be in use.  Off to
the left there looks to be a little wooden side board that is well polished
with age and has various pictures of friends and family decorating the top
of it.  As well a door that leads to a bedroom and bathroom.

`wBedroom`n~
A quiet room that is softly decorated with different hue's of purple and
white there is a good sized queen sized bed that is made of light oak wood. 
It is set up sort of like a canopy but instead of the arched top it has
sheer off white curtains that are usually pulled back with a royal purple
cord.  The bed spread of the bed is a fluffy goose down that is patterned
with off white satin and variouse shades of light purple velvet squares . 
There are lots of pillows at the head of the bed that are both satin and
velvet, they are shaped in different sizes and shapes in the same colors of
the bedspread.  There is a small matching night stand next to the with a
pretty stained glass tiffany style lamp with an alarm clock and coaster
sitting next to it.  Directly across from the bed there is a medium matching
dresser that is ornately carved with a mirror.  On top of the dresser are
various pieces of jewelry and a couple bottle of perfume along with other
nick-nacks that have been placed there in passing.  Along the floor there
are different shaped thick off-white rugs as well as several wrote-iron
candle stands with different colored and sized candles on them.  The room it
self is light and airy and at night there are many different candles other
then the ones along the floors that give the room a soft glow.

`eThick black carpeting that causes all footfalls to sink in at least an
inch lines the floor of the living room. A kitchenette is visible past a 
small section of black marble counterspace, and a selection of assorted

Two black leather couches sit in a L-shape, countered by a large shelf
packed with unmarked books. A flat-screen television is mounted upon the
wall above the shelf, it's corresponding remote being cast idly upon one
of the couches. `n

`pA Large, Lavish Bedroom`n~
`eThe first most apparant thing in this bedroom is the distinct lack of 
light; the thick darkness is made further difficult to discern by 
cannisters of sandlewood incense that send twisting curls of smoke 
into the air, placed in several locations throughout the room. The only
source of light is a black frosted sconce in the shape of a dragonfly
that takes up a large portion of the wall above a lengthy, short
dresser of ebony wood. The room itself is gigantic, much larger than
one would have imagined plausible in an apartment. The ceilings and
walls are draped with black velvet, making the entirety of the room
seem enclosed by a relatively looming, dark void. Thick black carpet
that causes all footfalls to sink in at least an inch covers the floor.
Taking up the vast majority of the huge room is a bed that is rested
atop - or more logically, inside - a frame of black pewter that spirals
in the shape of an intricate web around the thick, considerably over
stuffed mattresses. A set of black matte, metal handcuffs are linked
to one side of the bedframe, and dangle over the head of the mattress.
Velvet pillows, black satin sheets and coverlets pile upon the bed,
enclosing the occupant in complete comfort. Heavy security is installed
to the door to the east, requiring a code to be punched into a number
pad for entrance.`n

`pA Pillow-Filled Sitting Room`n~
`eA dark ethereal room lit from above by a single circular black bulb
shaded several dozen times over by drapes of deep sheer scarlet and black
that layer across the ceiling in drooping arcs, covering it completely from
one edge to the other; only the faintest, dimmest irridescent black glow
manages to filter through to light the room, providing a faint outline of
all things within, and all colors to light or glow in a fairly strange
manner.  The carpet is thick and black, and the walls layered in black
velvet.  The entire room is filled with large, silk, satin and linen slipped
pillows, some with crystalline bead-dropped edges, some with wide stripes of
dark crimson or black, depending upon their base color, but all massive
enough to be nearly the size of a chair on their own, providing places to
lie down, sit, recline, or anything else for one to two people upon or
within each one.  There is nothing in the room but these massive pillows and
the sways of the sheer silks of the ceiling and the thick velvet of the
walls. `n

velvet, as is the relatively high ceiling, making this room of moderate size
seem to be enclosed in a dark void. What would appear to be an masseuse table
were it not for the thick leather top and genuine anchor chain restraints is
installed at the very center of the room. Upon ebony racks that line the walls
are a series of tools; a locking open mouth gag, several leather tools, and a
heavy duty spreader bar restraint with black matte steel eyebolts attached
securely to each end. Upon a pedastal against the far east wall is a velvet 
lined box of cold marble. Hanging from the ceiling by huge, secure bolts that
have been affixed through the steel and fabric are additional anchor chains,
and several heavy duty padlocks are affixed on the large rungs, currently
unlatched. The door to the west is heavily secured with a number pad upon the
frame to engage or disengage the locks. `n

area that reads -$3 Park All Night- This place is nothing more than a flat
of concrete with yellow painting seperating different parking spaces.  A
cardboard box or two sit near the back of the lot against one of the run
down buildings.  Broken bottles of booze can be seen scattered about.

Red and white square tile composes the floor, walls and ceiling, stained
with dry ketchup and mustard that never quite seems to come fully clean. 
The Krystal Burger runs on a twenty-four hour schedule, open seven days a
week, and is home to many of Bourbon Streets drunkest and least lucrative
party-goers as well as locals looking for some quick fast-food grub.  There
are only four of the cheap white plastic tables, the chairs swivelling yet
attached to the structure of the tables' bases.  Most customers grab their
food and go, but the tables are usually occupied by one or two wasted and
groggy drunkards.  The counter is home to a cash register, and the menu is
above eye-height on the wall behind, back-lit with pictures of almost
everything up for order.  The employees are brightly dressed in red and
yellow stripes with very ridiculous cone-shaped hats.  It smells like fry
oil, burgers, hotdogs and condiments.

#wH#earding's #wI#envestigation and #wS#eecurity #w[#eLobby#w]#n~
White marble blocks tile the stately floor, long expanses of the lobby
illuminated by greyish panes of light cast by the tinted windows that line
the entire front, giving way to a broad, darkened view of Royal Street.  The
interior architecture is flawlessly modern, with angular ceilings and alcoves
cut into the textured matte steel itself in the shape of half-circle arches,
from which suspend hanging-sconces of the same textured, thin metal, casting
white light in dappled ovals across the floor beneath them.  The rest of the
lobby's lighting comes from pale fixtures installed into the walls
themselves, shaded with paper so as to soften their glow.  The doors in the
southern wall are directed by weight, sliding open to give way to the
outdoors - or the opposite - when a person draws near.  Polished wooden
benches that echo of pews, composed of a solid, dark ebony with
contrastingly white runner-cushioning, are set along the western and eastern
walls, affixed with magazine and newspaper racks.  The walls themselves vary
in appearance between off-white and white, depending upon the time of day,
appearing more beige by the natural light the windows filter in, and white
by the artificial bulbs used past dusk.  Lit shadow boxes with glass covers
built into the walls display the Private Investigators license of the
proprietor, along with a few framed newspaper mentions from across the
United States with mention of the same name.  A buzzer and intercom near a
single door in the northern wall, opposite the entrance, permits those
seeking audience to contact anyone within the office, and a leatherbound
book upon a podium beside it permits visitors to leave phone numbers, names
or other notations should their call not be answered.

`wA`ebernethy`w P`erivate `wI`envestigating `w[`eOffice`w]`n~
Pale cream textured walls and pillars with dark oiled crown moulding are
the frame of this comfortable office, being predominantly rectangular in
shape, with two pillars on either side leading into small alcoves.  Each
alcove is set with a dark, stout bookshelf filled with texts upon any number
of subjects, held in the majority by theoretical analysis on topical
forensics, and one blackberry velvet cushioned window seat built into the
wall, beneath a narrow pane of glass shaded by thick hangings of the same
fabric and colour as the seat cushions; a spiraling iron staircase leads up
into the ceiling from the western alcove, marking the only difference
between the two.  The first portion of the main office is floored in an
off-white marble tile, centered by a square woven rug of the same neutral
tones.  Where the tile leaves off rich blackberry carpeting picks up,
leading one to a massive antiqued desk with a a slim leather datebook,
mounted fountain pen and a flat screen computer monitor in matte black upon
it.  The smell of the wood oils used to polish and clean the room is a thick
presence, layered with the light scent of something soft and potentially
floral.  A fully set lounge area is easily contained independently by the
expansive room, enclosed upon itself across the carpeting, with a black
velvet love seat and two matching wingback chairs composed of heavy leather.
Four narrow floor-to-ceiling windows conjoined by frames line the
northernmost wall, behind the desk, and an old-fashioned iron chandelier
with artificial lighting that can be dimmed or brightened by remote control
hovers above it.  A file cabinet sits flush to the wall left of the desk,
behind which has been installed an intercom box for communication with the
lobby.

The scent of rubbing alcohol and othersuch sterile odors hover in this
clean, almost perfectly square room.  A myriad of lockers, cabinets and
boxes in dramatically differing sizes, each composed of polished, stainless
steel with a labelled number and lock line every ounce of wallspace in the
immediate area, leaving a small portion near the back for a stainless steel
table with a black leatherbound log-book and box-encased fountain pen set
upon it.  The floor is a perfectly clean white tile, and the light switch
beside the doorframe floods the room with a nearly blinding white glow from
five flourescent light panels in the low ceiling.  Beside the sole table is
a moderately sized area fenced off from the rest of the room by a swing-down
metal gate fixed with a padlock, filled with sealed plastic tubs and boxes
of what appear to be legal pistol and rifle ammunition.

#gFoundation House of New Orleans#G;#g 'Sign in' and Foyer #G(#gNPCs#G:#g 4#G)#n~
Field stone and plaster walls lend an aged appearance to the joined rooms
of this large complex with their highly polished heart oak floors stained a
high buffed mocha, lending warmth and blending perfectly with the deep
garnet of the walls where the plaster comfortably lingers.  Warm photographs
of what could be assumed to be residents hung in heavy frames adorn three
walls of the expansive room between high arched windows covered in a thick
velvet corniced drapes over Irish lace panels.  Two intricate wrought iron
floor-to-ceiling panels divide the room, brushing against the open beamed
ceiling, dried bundles of herbs and potpourri mingled here and there.  A
simple ceiling mounted oak lighting system dangles over a rounded iron wood
desk with a Spanish colonial air, matching several other pieces about the
shared rooms.  A Hacienda armoire of burnished mesquite rests in a corner
hiding away the coats and jackets of new arrivals, a spindly ivy plant
resting a top it.  A black hand-painted French credenza topped with a
beveled mirror stands beside the desk, simple glass sconces giving a
comfortable warmth to the room, the contents being clean white pillows and
blankets.  A sidedoor upon the west wall is locked, but an identical pair of
them the eastern wall lie open, friendly painted signs describing them as
either a men or women's lavatory.  Behind the desk a tired looking man sits,
requiring sign-ins from all persons arriving at the shelter.  To the north a
large archway opens into a warm sitting room, where it would appear a fair
number congregate at all hours.

#gFoundation House of New Orleans#G;#g Office#n~
Simple graceful lines make up this well-used, deep sage green room with
its small leaded glass windows crafted in the gothic architectural style,
which continues on by means of design to the furnishings.  Dark maple book
shelves bank three of the four walls, stretching to the ceiling, each and
every available space lined with bound texts or orderly notebooks ranging in
topic from religious tomes, to the many facets of political science and
sociology.  A stately desk resides in the far corner of the room, its
simplistic lines off set by the high backed rolling leather office chair
settled in behind it.  A laptop with all the bells and whistles sits a top
the desk flanked by framed snap shots of far off places, labelled in silvery
ink as 'Jules and Pat, Dublin 2003' or other various phrases along the same
line.  A work table with the same clean lines takes up the other half of the
room, chairs of various styles banked up to it.  A light box rests ready for
use upon the table top, a small television with DVD player and VCR not far
off with an overly neat pile of notebooks and ballpoint pens.  Just past a
pillow banked window seat an oak door rests slightly ajar to show the
trappings of a well appointed darkroom, several pictures dangling from a
line to dry.  A small lacquered table near the window seat holds an odd
assortment of religious items from a pyx burse to curled piles of rosaries
and a rite book, a single white candle dotted amongst them.  An almost
modern spiral stairway reaches upward into the loft of the building, while
across the room the oaken door leading back to the main house awaits.

#gLoft above Foundation House of New Orleans#n~
Obviously once the attic space of the carriage house, heavy oak beams
have been left open to show the angle of the roof, a single large scaled
arched window the only view to the outside, the top panel a stained glass
depiction of a sunset over-looking an old-world view of New Orleans.  A
massive geometric harlequin patterned Pollaro bed done in oak with intricate
rosewood inlay dominates an ample portion of the main space, appearing built
directly into the walls.  Linens of rich cotton appoint the bed, in stark
contrast to the simple oak walls, left completely unfinished for their
natural appeal.  An oversized leather chest sits at the foot of the bed with
an antiquated pile of books upon it, a bundle of what would appear to be
sage sticks tied with twine positioned above the topmost text.  Several oak
candle holders bedecked with thick white candles are ringed about the room,
two perched near the head of the bed.  A slender, overstuffed slipper chair
sits positioned under the window beside an unpainted wicker table holding a
domed glass lamp that casts light over a battered notebook, ballpoint pen
still laying in the crease of it.  Photographs and books of various sizes
and shapes line a carved hearth mantle, attached over a firebox holding
several candles backed in glass to sparkle light about the room.  A large,
hearty oak cabinet takes up the remaining wall space, offering storage for
linens and clothing, in addition to countless texts, tomes and literature
forms of all types, which also fill many other shelves in the loft.  Honey
toned wooden floors gleam, disappearing under a subtly patterned area rug,
more an comfort piece than actual floor covering, used to draw together a
seating area.  Two black leather, wooden swoop armed chairs nestle in under
an glass pendant light tinted scarlet to yellow from base to tip, with a
stout oak table at the center possessed of a built-in rack filled with
bottles of Jamesons Irish Whiskey and packs of Camel Lights.

#gFoundation House of New Orleans#G;#g Cellar#n~
Down the spiraled stairway an unfinished space opens up under the glare
of bare electric bulbs.  Dirt floors still linger here with heavy rough
stone walls, giving the large room a natural chill common to root cellars. 
Boards and tools are leaned here and there in out of the way corners showing
signs of improvements being made to the room.  Several sets of old wooden
shelves bank the windowless walls, an antiquated canning table still set
dead center, a few rusted meat hooks lingering from the rafters over head. 
A jumbled pile of Rubbermaid containers holding various odds and ends are
stacked just behind the stairway reaching almost fully to the ceiling in a
precarious leaning tower.  Set off in the furthest corner of the room rests
an old key locked roll top desk with two newer leather office chairs, the
dirt floor covered in a large rag rug under them.  Sat just beside it rests
a large dull gray metal storage cabinet with a padlock firmly in place.  On
the exact opposite of the room is a massive industrial washer and dryer,
several baskets of linens, blankets, pillowcases, clothes, and the
occasional stuffed animal or ragdall folded or piled within them.

#CThe Cage at Adrenochrome (#cAvg NPCs#C:#c 3#C)#n~
`cAt the top of a curling spiral staircase composed of solid neon-blue
iron lies this platform, encircled by similarly neon-blue poles to hold the
'prisoner' inside.  There is a door in the bottom of the cage to allow for
coming and going, but upon investigation it can be easily discerned that the
bolt only slips from the outside.  The floor is a see-through tank, with
numerous green illuminated fish swimming amidst plants and other tank-decor,
and from the ceiling hangs a swing with not-so-subtly placed holes, genuine
bondage gear including a flogger, whips, manacles, cuffs, face-masks,
ball-gags and wall-bonds.  The activities of the occupants are fully visible
to the throbbing crowds below, who oftentimes become so enthralled with the
goings on in the cage that they stop dancing to merely watch.  `n

#CAdrenochrome (#cAvg NPCs#C:#c 45+#C)#n~
`cTransparent, thick doors of neon-blue tinted plastic part, giving way
to an outright assault on the senses consisting of flashing, throbbing,
swirling lights that dance and flicker across see-through glass floors that
display beneath them thousands of swimming goldfish and koi, wet
traffic-light green and television-screen blue light pours through the
water, drenching every plant, rock and decoration in surreal illumination. 
The walls are painted a deep midnight black and covered with an intricate
lighting system; little blue and green bulbs no larger than Christmas lights
stab out from behind the thick painted plaster, blinking on and off in rapid
succession and acting as the only light in the club save for that which
seeps up through the murky waters beneath ones feet.  Floor to ceiling
mirrors line the right and left sides, surrounded still by those tiny
flickering lights, and the ceiling itself is one solid mirror.  A spiral
staircase of solid neon-blue iron curls up through the ceiling and the club
itself stretches westward.  There is a low, curving, see-through neon green
and blue plastic ledge for drinks, and high-backed green-velvet stools line
the whole of the bar.  Behind the bar itself are several small, raised
platforms, where fully nude dancers -- provided by patrons alone -- twist
and gyrate around shiny blue-steel poles.  `n

#CAdrenochrome #c-#C Room Rentals#n~
#cThe throbbing music from the club below becomes more of a dull pulse in
this hallway, seperated from the Baby Seal by a thick pair of neon-blue
transparant doors.  The floor here, on the second floor, is not like that of
the lower story; hideous casino carpet like one might expect in Vegas spans
across the whole of the hallway and upper lobby, so visually painful that
the eyes are pushed from it automatically, and onto the bizarre artwork that
lines the walls, which have been painted in intricate, broad swirls of
television-screen blue and wet traffic-light green.  The artwork displayed
on the walls is at best, disturbing.  Blue-tinted photography depicts
corpses lined up by the thousands in piles during the Holocaust, dead whales
on green-tinted beaches, even simple things, like alleyways and desolate
plains, all with a turquiose or verdant tint.  There are locked doors with
card-swipes on the western and eastern walls, and a booth with a man sitting
behind it who will rent one of the rooms by the hour or by the night. #n

#CThe #gJ#Gu#yn#og#Gl#ge#C Room #c(#CAdrenochrome#c)#n~
`cA huge bed, king-sized at the least, has been built into a faux grey
stone frame that is held aloft by thick vine-entwined chains that hang from
the ceiling.  Even the slightest movement upon the thick, stuffed bed sends
the frame swinging rhythmically back and forth.  The floor is a thick green
carpet that reminds one of grass or other such foliage, and the walls are
painted to appear like a dark night sky, which is a simple thing when the
only light comes from a rice-paper rendition of a full, yellow moon, hanging
like a disco ball in the very center of the ceiling.  The bed is set with
leopard spotted and tiger striped coverlets, along with sleek black,
slippery satin black sheets and pillows.  Subtly playing in the background
from unseen speakers are the quiet sounds of a jungle; insects chirp, the
occasional monkey cries, and the sound of something running through tall
grasses can be discerned.  A deep jacuzzi style bathtub composed of faux
black and grey granite sinks into the floor in one corner, and set on top of
a similarly granite table beside it is a Bible, a mini-box of condoms, and
travel-sized bottle of personal lubricant.  `n

#CThe #gU#Gn#Cd#ce#gr#Gw#ca#Ct#Ge#gr#C Room #c(#CAdrenochrome#c)#n~
`cA gigantic, clear water bed filled with swimming green and orange fish
takes up the vast majority of this room, which is illuminated by neon blue
rope lights along the edges of the floor boards.  The bed is set with
slippery neon-blue satin sheets and is piled at the head with matching
pillows.  The floor is solid, dark blue, making it seem, with the limited
light, as though there is no floor at all, simply an abyss that extends
infinitely downward.  From the ceiling drapes a length of sheer indigo
colored cloth, dotted here and there with sparkling green rhinestones, which
encircles the bed and can be drawn to a close when additional privacy is
desired by the occupants.  The walls are the same hue as the floor, and
mural artwork depicting sleek, black waterlife appear to move unless one
focuses closely upon them.  From the ceiling, which is covered almost
entirely in neon colored, fake plantlife, hang remarkably real looking
plastic or mache fish, dangling from fishing line so as to appear as though
they simply hover there on their own.  Playing in a subtle way at all times
from unseen speakers is the vague sound of churning water, as it would sound
for one who is currently beneath it.  A deep jacuzzi-style bathtub composed
of faux blue and green granite sinks into the floor in one corner, and set
on top of a similarly granite table beside it is a Bible, mini-box of
condoms, and travel-sized bottle of personal lubricant.  `n

`gThickening foliage`n~
Majestic oaks sink deep roots into the dry earth here, towering overhead,
giving way underneath to palmetto.  Nearby croaks of frogs, and various
clicks and chirps can be heard from the yet unseen variety of small animals,
reptiles and insects.  The smell of swampland is strong here and isn't very
pleasant.  Smelly mud and wood rot permeate the nose and the surrounding
area grows dimmer with the thickening foliage.  Through the thicket of trees
there is a rare sign of civilization, being a small dirt parking lot choked
on all sides by looming foliage.  A path leads from the lot into the woods.

`gBoggy ground`n~
Spongy moss and an increasing odor indicate more dampness, rot, mold and
the palmetto gives way somewhat to cypress, growing up from the spongy roots
within the water in the low ground areas.  Like many legged ghosts, standing
within the dark water their boughs draped with Spanish moss and the trees
mixed in with willow and other flora.  Frogs are easily spotted, along with
a variety of spiders, crawfish and birds.  A dirt road runs the length of
the bog, with a few old houses, some occupied and some abandoned, managing
to survive the uncultured wetlands.  A rundown, vacant looking victorian era
home with boarded up windows sits nestled behind some large bushes that
nearly obscure it from the naked eye to the south, and to the east an aging
picket fence coated with fresh white paint runs along the edge of the dirt
road.  The expansive grounds of a Louisiana colonial stands behind the
fence, framed on all sides by oak, cypress and willows that form thick walls
to stave off the wild growth of the bayou.

`gDeep within the swamp`n~
A shadowy world of swampland lies here.  Even in midday the humidity
makes any breeze that stirs, dampen the skin.  Small animals, mostly
nocturnal, can be spotted if a careful observer is quiet while moving within
the area.  Raccoon, squirrels, and muskrat all abound.  Sassafras and wild
iris provide ample landing pads for a broad spectrum of butterflies. 
Through a tangle of trees and odorous sinkholes one can spy the remains of
an iron gate to the north, and a crumbling sugar cane plantation.

the water from a log, swimming expertly crossing to another patch of
cypress.

Resting on a twisted bit of cypress root a turtle takes a break from
swimming.  A few blossoming water plants float lazily about and
thick green covers almost half of the pond's surface.  The banks are
mushy and spongy and perhaps an occasional spot of quicksand could
be waiting for an unsuspecting traveler, be it animal or human, to step
into it.  Wading about one edge is a heron and several egrets, dipping
their long bills into the water picking up an occasional small fish and
gulping it down.

`gA huge, gnarled cypress`n~
Dominant and massive, the roots of this gigantic cypress shoot up out of
the ground in large, gnarled arcs, laden from the very top of the high, dark
branches to the lowest of the roots in Spanish moss.  The tree stretches up
so far into the night sky that it blocks off even the slightest hint of the
moon or stars when standing beneath it, and the branches are so dense with
bark and curling leaves that it impossible to discern where one ends and the
other begins without some exterior light source.  There seem to be a series
of hand and foot holds in the massive trunk, naturally embossed to the
surface of the bark to allow for climbing into the branches.

E
rules~
`wThe rules for this Elysia are as follows, designated by Keeper Juliet 
O'Riley as of August 12th, 2006.`n
`n
`R--`n Absolutely no uses of vampiric disciplines or powers of any kind, save 
for the blood magic of the Tremere, which cannot be used in an offensive 
(See: Anything that effects or could possibly effect another Kindred) or
concealatory way.
`n
`R-- `nNo weapons permitted on the premesis, save for those in the possession 
of the ghouled guards. This means no guns, knives, pocket knives, stakes, 
'randomly sharpened items' be they wood or metal, torches, tazers, blunt 
weapons -- anything that could possibly perceived as a weapon is better 
left in your haven. If you are found with a weapon on you -- of any sort, 
and this is up to the discretion of the Keeper or the guards designated to 
search each person upon their entrance to Elysium -- it will be confiscated. 
Depending on the seriousness of the implications made by an attempt to cart 
a weapon into Elysium with this rule in place, there may be additional 
measures taken, past the initial confiscation. The weapons will not be 
returned. Do not bring them to Elysium. (Note: Until further notice, canes 
are permitted.)
`n
`R-- `nDo not bring your mortal ghouls to Elysium without first clearing it 
with the Keeper, long ahead of time. Thus, do not show up with your thrall 
and inquire about it then. Attain permission beforehand, so that a proper 
level of knowledge may be ascertained about the ghoul before admitting 
them into Elysium, (or, for that matter, before they may know the 
location of the Elysium at all).
`n
`R--`n Violence in any form of any kind is strictly and expressly forbidden. In 
the case that a Kindred is attacked by another, the attacking vampire may 
consider himself no longer protected by Elysium, and in near to almost all 
cases will be destroyed by those present. Any Kindred may be struck down 
within Elysium at the moment he committs an act of violence. No exceptions 
made and no reason is great enough, save for unarguable self-defense, or in
defending a Kindred who has been attacked by another.
`n
`R--`n While it is the Keepers' duty to make all rules of Elysium known ahead 
of time, when they are made public and available for all Kindred to read, 
as is, it is the Kindred in questions' duty to educate himself. Ignorance 
of the rules is not an excuse.
`n
`GOOC Notations:`n The Keeper may immediately remove 200 points of status from 
any Kindred she catches breaking the Masquerade. If she does not witness 
it herself, sufficient evidence must be brought forth. This removal costs 
the Keeper nothing. This is merely the usual punishment for minor 
characters and a minor breach; the more important the Kindred or the larger 
the breach, the larger the punishment.
`n
It is expected that Kindred will aid a Keeper of Elysium if she is 
enforcing Elysium. The Sheriff is also expected to aid the Keeper in her 
duties if need be.

`gLouis Armstrong Public Park`w -`B Memorial`n~
This area, well shaded in the daytime from the hot sun by several large
trees, is filled with thick, healthy grass.  There is an abundance of
beautiful flowers of all different kinds making this particular area very
bright and colorful in the spring season.  There are several dark wood
benches around along with a small duck pond.  There is a small paved path
that leads through the park for hikers and bikers alike.  Several lamps are
positioned every few yards keeping the path lit at night.  The pavement
splits and forms a circle around a large patch of grass.  In the middle of
the grassy area is a stone statue.  The statue is of a large horse and it's
rider, who is a beautiful woman dressed in what seems to be armor.  Her back
is straight and she sits atop her horse proudly as if ready for anything
life may throw her way.  There is a brass plaque attached to the base of the
statue.

At first glance this just appears to be an unused warehouse with varied
sizes of wood crates and an old forklift in the corner which has it's engine
stripped apart.  Some bare bulbs overhead still give dim light if the power
switch is flipped on.  Large hooks, still sharp but dull brownish red in color
hang from a long railing running the length of this main room.  Rubber
flaps in each wall where the rail enters and leaves the room indicate the
manner in which carcasses were brought into and sent out of this processing
room.  A dust covered sign on the wall announces, "Faber's Meat Packing -
When Quality Counts."  A few old stacked up folding chairs and several
industrial size double sinks are along one wall. Above one of the sinks
in what appears to be blood, is a symbol of an inverted spiked cross, with
a spiked circle at the base of it.

Narrow and dim, these older streets of the city are crowded with three
and four story buildings of white, pink and gray brick.  Most of them now in
various states of decay, they are used for more mechanical or industrial
type businesses or are abandoned altogether.  Some house rental storage or
commercial storage areas.  This isn't an area many tourists would come to
visit, particular in the evening or night hours.

The brilliant lights of the french quarter are visible to the east, where
Decatur swallows up the commercial feel of the warehouse district, causing
it to fade away entirely.

#rLittle Darlings (Avg. NPCs: 32)#n~
Heavy metal doors of brushed steel swirl-pattern part to assault the
senses with flashing, strobing, swirling lights that dance and flicker
across the expansive polished wood floor, catching the eye through a haze of
smoke and heady aroma of liquor, sweat and desire.  Walls painted a deep
matte black, seems to suck up the glare from the neon bombshells that hang
perched there as an enticing backdrop, giving a seamless line where it
touches the floor.  Floor to ceiling mirrors, shadowed with a gray haze
about the edges, cover the entire back wall and the ceiling, reversing the
room and lighting back on itself to give a 360 view of the entertainment. 
Three large under lit catwalk stages, rimmed with amber tinted rope lights
and a low wooden ledge for drinks, offer up entertainment across the main
body of the floor, high-backed red velvet stools ringing them for those who
wish to get an up close and personal view.  A rounded metal topped bar cuts
an oasis in the very center of the room sunken three steps below the main
floor, small raised platforms topped with shiny steal poles and cages give a
vertical break from the round form now and again, offering eye candy in
various states of dress and movement.  An elevated DJ cage of clear tempered
glass, backlit with pulsing lights is nestled at a lofty height near the
largest of the stages, thumping out the grinding beat, or silky sexy strains
as two slinky bodies pulse to either side, framing it.  Red velvet covered
doors lead off in the cardinal directions leading to private rooms, the rest
rooms, and staff only areas.  A raised balcony skirts the room on three
sides, offering secluded alcoves dotted with booths, leopard print sofas and
club chairs in a smooth black harlequin pattern.

#rDressing Room at Little Darlings#n~
This lengthy room, tucked back behind the main stage is a mish-mash of
dressing tables, strewn with cosmetics and body paint, half discarded
costumes and sweaty bodies sliding into slinky garments just before the next
dance.  Battered dressing screens painted with garish scenes block off
corners, draped in stockings and garters they obscure a dull set of dinged
gray metal lockers, names written on white tape denoting owners.  Hard back
chairs offer a seat before the dressing table mirrors taped with photos and
mementos to give a bit of personal flair.  Stark white walls offer little
interest, paired with a worn green carpet dotted with dark stains here and
there, the heavy smell of baby oil and apple blossom perfume hanging heavy
in the air.

leads towards several VIP rooms.  A simple bar sits just near the elevator
for those that need more drinks taken to their VIP room.  Security cameras
watch the hallway, assuring that the girls are being treated properly.

#rA VIP Room at Little Darlings#n~
Walls draped in thick falls of rich crimson velvet flank a raised wooden
dais, four leveled steps from the floor.  A single, black leather armless
chair occupies a throne like position on the wooden platform, the hot seat
for many a private lap dance.  The fabric drenched walls dull the thrumming
and din of the outer rooms, making a private world all its own.  Speakers
dot the ceiling, leading back to a cabinet encased cd player topped with a
mirrored drink caddy, thick leaded glass bottles holding varied amber
colored liquids.  Mood lighting keeps a smooth sexy vibe to the air, dimmed
with a simple flick of the switch.  A single slim metal pole, with a
gleaming bronze finish cuts the only sharp vertical angle in the room,
making a tempting play thing for nimble bodies.  The deep red door leads
back toward the main room.

`oSpawning Pools`n~
If America is the melting pot of the world, then this is the melting pot of 
the sewers of New Orleans. Or perhaps 'writhing pot' would be a better term. If 
it weren't for large number of vermin, beetles, slugs, rats and other such 
creatures fighting for location, one would notice the faintly red-tinged water 
that sits stagnant at least several feet deep. The stench prevalent in the rest 
of the sewers is considerably more putrid, the combined decay of dead things and 
the very walls themselves cut through the nostrils of any who tread here. 
Descending further into the pit, huge, multi-colored, sickening masses of even 
more squirming creatures are discernable at the center of the pool, ringed by 
garbage, algae, moss and other subterranean plants that grow upon the surface. 
The lowest parts of the walls are caked caked with frothing, congealed blood 
both fresh and old. Any Nosferatu would instantly recognize this as a spawning 
pool.
`n
`w((`CPlease`w request`C to place blood into the pool. Keep in mind (as is common Clan 
sense), that it's probably a bad idea to try to get a hold on the local spawning 
pool without `wpermission`C or the`w capability`C to back up the action.`w))`n

#bThe Atrium#n~
This expansive room is shaped almost like a dome, the roof soaring
upwards and held there by an expanse of support beams.  The walls are
papered a deep, velvety blue, quite soft to the touch.  Polished mahogany
doors dominate here to the east and west, and at one end of the room is a
large staircase of polished oak with two curling bannisters of the same
material on the sides, tapering from its wide expanse on the floor up to the
second story.  It is furnished with several sets of plush blue chairs in
various arrangements throughout, with a large, unused fireplace set in one
corner.  A large table of oak is set here or there amongst the chairs, and
the walls themselves are occasionally covered by a tall, well-kept bookcase.

#rSparse Quarters#n~
If one would manage to make it inside here, they would find that the door
leading in is even more heavily reinforced on the inside than the out,
veritably covered in latches, deadbolts, and other locks.  This room is
somewhat spacious, though not particularly well-furnished.  A bed with a
comfortable mattress and a few blankets rests upon the western wall, a small
desk to the north.  The north wall in front of the desk is covered in
screens, each labelled by camera location, depicting security camera feeds
in both color and infrared from each part of the house.  A telephone is
hooked up to rest upon the desk, along with a laptop computer.  The walls
are bare aside from this, and there is nothing even hinting at luxury aside
from the bed in the room.

#eThe Guest Rooms #b(#eAverage NPCs`b: #e2#b)#n~
This portion of the house seems to have been divided up into about eight
seperate rooms, each large enough to live and move about in, but none of
them particularly spacious.  It seems at least half of them are occupied at
all times, sometimes more, sometimes less.  Lights built into the wooden
tiled ceiling illuminate the halls here, and the walls are all burnished
wood, with a faint scent of pine hanging in the air of the hall.  Generally
there is some form of activity here, and occasionally music or the like can
be heard from behind one of the closed doors.

#rUpstairs - The Hallway#n~
With the large, sprawling staircase down to the Atrium at one end, this
hallway seems rather confined by comparison, hung with various paintings of
generally abstract work and on a variety of topics.  As one proceeds down
the way, one would see a large, mahogany door that leads to the north,
obviously sporting a reinforced lock.  The walls themselves are also of bare
wood, though this a deep, polished walnut that can be seen occasionally when
it is not covered with paintings.

This particular room is composed of varying hues of deep crimson, from
the large four-poster bed at rests against the northern wall to the various
deep red square rugs that cover the floor.  Several chests rest against the
walls of the room, each atop a rug, and there is a small, waist-high
bookshelf on either side of the bed.  The ceiling has flourescent lights
that flip on and off via a switch near the door and the bed.

#gThe Library#n~
This underground room is lead to by a long, metal-runged ladder built
into the wall, covered up by an half-full chest covered by a rug in the
bedroom, mostly in an enclosed shaft that's no more than two feet by two
feet in terms of dimensions, until one gets to the bottom.  At about the
last five rungs the ladder opens up into a rather small room that's entirely
packed with books.  All of the shelves are practically fountaining with
materials, though none of them seem to be particularly titled.  The shelves
themselves seem to be organized, instead, by topic, and at one end of the
room is a large desktop computer on an even larger desk, the rest of which
is covered in writing utensils, papers, and so forth.  The room is barely
lit by a few incredibly dim lights built into the ceiling that would
normally make reading next to impossible, but incredibly faint rays of light
do reach every portion of the room.  To the west is a single, lone door,
near the desk.  It seems to be quite sturdily locked.

This is a well-lit clinical style room just like the rest of the
hospital.  There are three stainless steel tables in the center of the tiled
floor with drains strategically placed around them.  A large embalming
machine trailing cords and hoses can be rolled between the three tables when
there is a 'client' that needs its services.  A rolling table laden with the
tools of the trade sits beside the embalming machine.  The left wall is
lined with steel doors, giving it that all too familiar look scene in the
movies.  Along the right wall cabinetry and large sinks.  Upon the walls
there are all sorts of charts and tools hanging by proper equipment and
sanitary devices.

random offices, or various police postings upon the wall.  The only thing
noticeable is the sign on the door in the distance, reading "City Morgue."

#eMain Pump Room`n~
You enter a dank dark room smelling slightly moldy with large rusty pipes
hanging overheard..  In various places ancient looking pipes stand, shadows
of their former selfs.  Far more startling however is the furnishings..  A
table, a small moldy couch..  All covered in what appears to be corpes in
various states of decay, some skeletal, others fresh from the casket maggots
still burrowing their ways into the flesh.  Two red dots form in the
darkness looking to be eyes..  But are quickly revealed to be but ancient
buttons to a shattered panel.  Overhead a small sign proclaims this an
"#waux.  Fallout shelter.  #n" while another seems to read "#w Last
inspected _Augest_1952_#n" against the wall appears the rusted beginnings of
a ladder, and a thick metallic Hatch lays rusted on the floor nearby.  A
large sign proclaims "127" days since the last accident...  Blood is
splattered upon it.  #n

`eA Small Basement `C(`wHoly Ground - 1`C)`n~
The soft glow of candles illuminates this small basement.  The glow from
the red and white candles that have been placed around the room on shelves
and on candelabras fills the room with repose and reverence.  In the room
stand a few empty shelving units, save for items that were used in the
upkeep of the building above, and other various things, strangely enough
including books and statuettes of Saints.  Various pipes run along the
ceiling and walls, most of them emanating from a large furnace that has long
fallen silent.  Placed against the Eastern Wall is a small Altar, with red
candles upon it, and above the Altar a medium sized Crucifix has been placed
against the wall.  Tucked away against western wall are a few cots, and
small table and chairs have been placed near there also.  The exit leading
up into the building has long been blocked off, and the only exit back out
to the street is an old steel door.

The living room appears to be decorated more for comfort than
presentability.  Three long sofas surround a sturdy wooden table, and a
television takes up the other side.  Outside of the ring of sofas are a few
scattered chairs and a table, apparently for dining.  A few game systems are
plugged into the television, but have some dust gathered around them from
lack of use.  It is pretty obvious that whoever lives here rarely spends
time in this room.

There are a few speakers and amplifiers, as well as two microphones, a
couple guitars, and a bass, all set up as if regularly used.  A few homemade
spot lights, made from lightbulbs, coffee cans, and colored plastic, point
all around the simple stage.  A tall refridgerator sits near the door, along
with a washer and dryer.

of paper, boxes of computer parts, amps and a couple of guitars.  There is a

At first glance this appears to be a simple, unused storage facility with
varied sizes of wood crates and an old forklift in the corner which has it's
engine stripped apart.  Some bare bulbs overhead still give dim light if the
power switch is flipped on.  The walls are pure, solid concrete blocks
stacked atop one another with a high, arching roof with exposed beams of
copperish metal.  The massive metal doors are locked securely from the
inside and outside with numerous padlocks.  Absolutely no light manages to
penetrate the expansive interior of the storage building, and a chill hangs
in the air.

#GPat O'Brien's#n~
Surprisingly small, this part of the main pub sports a curved bar, small
round tables surrounded by two or three wood chairs and a small railed off
area for the Irish singer to perform his sets.  Thick smoke, rousing
choruses and audience participation are a must.

#RAn Abandoned Parking Garage#n~
This is a very large, enclosed area that was once the ground floor of a
parking garage, prior to the devastating effects of Katrina - now it sees no
traffic; the hard cement drives which had allowed vehicles passage now lie
boarded and barricaded, and the only entrance is a noisey aluminum swing-up
garage-styled door with a few rusty padlocks attached.  Despite it's
apparant lack of technical use it seems fairly intact, something that cannot
be said for the many levels above the bottom floor; the cement ground and
ceiling looks almost fresh, as though it had been recently added, very thick
with a rough estimate of perhaps ten feet or so in depth on either side. 
Paved columns are calculatedly spaced across the massive expanse of the
parking garage, these too reinforced with fresh layers of concrete.  There
are a dozen or so abandoned cars parked or more incidentally piled in one
corner, most of them severely dented up and damaged beyond any thought of
repair, and one wall is completely covered in large water barrels - the ones
used at busy intersections and on freeways to prevent vehicles from
experiancing excessive collision damage.  Here and there graffiti has been
sprayed onto the bare grey walls, depicting the occasional 'fuck,' 'I love
Margret' or 'Andy was here.' There appears to be something of a place to
gather at the center, rather like a large, empty arena with a shallow pit in
the middle filled with cigarette butts.

`rBedroom at Theo Vilmos' Office`n~
The bedroom is a basic one at first glance; or, at least, that is what it
truly wants you to believe.  The floor is simply buffed floorboards covered
with no rug nor trimming, simply bare and open - enough to give a hint of
space to the somewhat meagre room, though the sheer lack of furnishings
would also play a role in such.  The bed is stood with its head against the
broader wall, its entirety being made out of thin metalic beams in some
attempt to look drab while actually probably being rather comfortable, what
with the thick matress and several blankets and pillows, each one decked out
in plain white linen.  Little else occupies the dull space but a guarded,
shuttered-up window, a drab, boring wooden wardrobe and a small desk,
complete with a lamp and swivel-chair.  The lighting is dim, and the room
carries a heavy dose of dullness.

`cA small loft space`n~
The ceiling of this elongated, somewhat triangularly shaped attic space
is slanted, being eight feet at the highest point and six at the lowest with
exposed, finished beams stretching horizontally from one side to the other. 
There are no windows at all, and the walls are chaste and undecorous,
painted a calming cream colour that aesthetically contrasts the dark wood
moulding at the baseboards and around the door.  The floor is a simple,
clean beige berber and from the ceiling descends a combination light fixture
with an opaque glass sconce and a wide-bladed, lazily rotating fan.  A
single bed piled high with many down-filled blankets and more personal,
hand-made quilts sits flush to the wall opposite the door, nestled into a
small enclosure with a silver framed black and white photograph of Shannon
Hoon in a fedora mounted beside it.  A very large, thoroughly battered
travel trunk with a broken latch lies against another wall, presumably
filled with clothing, as there is no other sign of as much in the room, and
above it upon the wall is hung an oval full-length mirror.  A single
wall-mount ballet bar is affixed on the opposite side of the attic, and not
far away the wall itself has been built with shelving, where several glass
mason jars of boar bristle paintbrushes, pallets and oil paints in
squeezable tubes are stacked.  A portable easel in light aluminum rests to
the side of it, propped against the wall.  Tossed randomly about are a pair
of absolutely massive suede beanbag chairs in black.

This oriental rug shows a scene of two large animals in battle.  One is a

is obviously winning but both animals are indeed injured.  High above in the

`eWarehouse - A Studio`n~
Walls of red brick enclose this large warehouse studio in coarse, rough
texture.  Columns of the same stacked brick are built from hardwood paneled
floor to high ceiling, holding up the lofted roof.  If there are any windows
in the structure, they aren't visible behind the series of bookshelves, gym
equipment and furniture.  A large black matte steel entertainment center
with electronically sliding doors sits flush against the wall in a far
corner, nestled on all sides by thick black leather couches and chairs with
a dark shag carpet at the center of the arrangement.  One entire portion of
the studio is dedicated to solid rubber mats which house a red vinyl
punching bag, two speedbags, and a grey fabriced practice dummy, each
suspended on chains from the ceiling.  In between the two brick pillars
nearest the bags have been installed a set of monkey-bars.  Two of the walls
are lined completely with tall iron shelves, bearing books of all sizes and
genres.  A consistantly panning survelience camera trails back and forth,
installed into the far corner of the studio up near the angle between
ceiling and wall, and an iron railed staircase winds in a spiral up into the
ceiling, where a trap door can be seen crafted into the brick of the wall
itself.

lined on two walls with nothing but black and white display monitors showing
various scenes both inside the warehouse and outside it.  A steel control
panel can be flipped open to reveal a set of multiple colored buttons and
switches, all of which presumably are used in accordance with the security
equipment present here.  The floor is solid hardwood and the ceiling
remarkably high.  The only furniture in this room is a large, swiveling
black leather chair and a stout footstool with a leather cushion.

#eWarehouse - Roof#n~
An octagonal steel trap door opens to reveal a flagstone rooftop, with a
moderately sized patio cut into the roof on the side opposite the street,
allowing for complete privacy.  A few bird feeders are suspended from the
overhang above the patio, and even past nightfall the flutter of wings and
low chirp of avian life can be heard coming and going from this consistant
source of sustenence.  In the corner cast the furthest into shadow has been
installed a rather large jacuzzi hot tub lined with redwood paneling on the
outside, and pale sea-green tile on the inside, giving way here and there
for tiny, swiveling jets to spray bubbles or pour hot water into the
ever-filled, ever-clean tub.  Four headrests of thick, water-repelling
leather can be seen above the surface of the tub, bordered on both the left
and the right with waterfalls designed with small, dimly colored bulbs
inside, shifting color from green, blue and purple every few minutes.  A
digital LCD control panel can be seen on the right, next to what would
appear to be the 'main' seat.  A small liquor cabinet and redwood case with
a glass top -- obviously filled completely with Snickers bars -- is set
against the wall next to a circle of redwood patio furniture cushioned by
linen sewn, forest green pillows.  Beneath one of the chairs is a
double-tiered rack filled with porcelain bowls of dry catfood.

`eWarehouse - Bedroom`n~
The coarse red brick walls of this rather massive warehouse room have
been almost entirely covered from high, brick pillar supported ceiling to
hardwood paneled floor with large canvas murals; a scene depicting a broad,
star dotted sky of deep indigo blue has been afixed across the entire
ceiling, with a large, pale yellow-faced moon nestled into the far right
corner of mosiac texture rice-paper.  From several of the stars hang dim
bulbs ensconced in pale earthy-toned rice paper lanterns, suspended by clear
nylon wire.  The walls between the few iron shelves that contain an ample
amount of literature are covered with the same mounted canvas works, some
displaying scenes of the French Quarter by night enclosed in sinking fog,
but most of simple, unremarkable depictions; a night-time scene of dark
grass covered hills, twilight above the cypruss treetops of the New Orleans
swampland, or the occasional abstract skewing of a red star alone in an
otherwise empty black sky.  The overall effect of all-encompassing canvas
murals lends a surreal, clean sense of decor to what would otherwise be a
rather unremarkable space.  A bed supported by a massive iron frame sits
flush against one wall, requiring one to mount three steps in order to reach
the top mattresss.  A moderately sized sitting area is arranged on the side
of the room opposite the bed, composed of a few fat black leather chairs
surrounding a circular, glass-topped table with a minifridge and liquor
cabinet close at hand.

`bAn expansive studio loft`n~
Obviously once the attic space of the building, heavy oak beams have been
left open to show the angle of the roof, a single large scaled arched window
the only view to the outside, the top panel a stained glass depiction of a
sunset over-looking an old-world view of New Orleans.  Curtains of dark blue
silk appoint the window, in stark contrast to the simple oak walls, left
completely unfinished for their natural appeal.  An oversized leather chest
sits beside the stairwell with an antiquated pile of books upon it, a bundle
of what would appear to be sage sticks tied with twine positioned above the
topmost text.  Several oak candle holders bedecked with thick royal blue
candles are ringed about the room, two perched near the main sofa, which
boasts a fine oak frame inlaid with rosewood, and thick cushions of black
leather.  A slender, overstuffed Curacao slipper chair sits positioned under
the window beside a well oiled dark wooden table holding a domed glass lamp
that casts light over a heavy leatherbound journal, the pen still laying in
the crease of it.  Books of various sizes and shapes line a carved hearth
mantle, and a large, hearty oak cabinet takes up the remaining wall space,
offering storage for food and household supplies, well-positioned beside a
clean kitchenette with black appliances.  Honey toned wooden floors gleam,
disappearing under a neutral rug of knotted-rya, more an comfort piece than
actual floor covering, used to draw together the seating area.  Two leather
wooden swoop armed chairs nestle in under an glass pendant light tinted dark
blue, with a stout oak table at the center.  An open hallway leads to the
east, and a sliding glass door to the south leads one to a terraced balcony
over Royal Street.

`bA comfortable bedroom`n~
Wide bay windows curtained by soft forest-green gossamer overlook a clean
cobblestoned alleyway off Royal Street, the scent of the bakeries, numerous
coffee shops and tea houses filtering in to fill the room with a reminder of
their delectable - and close - presences.  The rich elegance of the bedroom
is overdone, with a massive geometrically carved Pollaro bed done in oak
with intricate rosewood inlay dominating an ample portion of the main space,
built directly into the wall.  Linens of rich Egyptian silk appoint the bed
in hues of black and dark green, with a perfect arrangement of concurrently
hued pillows and diamond shaped shams at the head.  A stout, dark antiqued
table sits before the windows, centered between a pair of black armchairs
pinstriped in jade, and their accompanying throw cushions.  A dark oiled
wooden armoire sits snug to the wall opposite the bed, filled with clothing
and personal effects.  An open hallway with a pair of carved shutter-doors
leads into a decadent bathroom, composed of gold-chased black marble from
the solid flooring to the walls and jacuzzi styled tub.  Fluffy, clean
towels are folded and stacked upon an iron shelving system beside the
full-length oval mirror with a dark wooden frame, and a few cosmetic items
are placed beside the deep marble sink.  The bedroom floor is a fine grained
cherry stained wood, covered with lavish carpeting that leaves exactly four
inches on either side between itself and the walls.  The lighting of both
the bathroom and bedroom is controlled by a remote control, which either
dims or increases the power of the bulbs behind oval glass shades, the
fixtures themselves being suspended from the ceiling in quartets.

`oA large pawn shop (Avg. NPCs: 4)`n~
Both a thick iron gate and a solid fire door slow entry to the shop,
lending insight to the manner of store, and perhaps the owners attitude to
unwelcome visitors.  It's not a big place, by any means, but it's big enough
for what it is, like most pawnbroker abodes; more or less square in it's
entirety with the majority of the room being fenced off behind cage-like
mock walls, the inner of those mesh blockades being riddled with various
second-hand merchandise ranging from clothing, jewellery, musical
instruments (mostly electric guitars) to televisions, VCR's and record
players - literally anything that somebody might have pawned in hard times. 
The counter is the only place illuminated by anything more than a shoddy
bulb; the glass box being lit by a fluorescent glass tube at it's base and
at the tip surface beneath the glass.  Within it are housed an array of
knives, pistols and ammunition, and within a locked metal cabinet behind are
what is likely shotguns and hunting rifles.  All in all, it's a pretty
dreary place, but where else are you going to get an illegal firearm and a
nice leather coat in the same store?

#wJackson Square (Avg. NPCs: 22)#n~
Surrounded by a massive iron-wrought fence still standing from the city's
French Colonial origins, Jackson Square was once a hub of elegance at the
center of the Quarter; an echo of an time long faded, where the homeless
would gather after dusk to interact and sleep under the light of the tall
iron lamps, long after ladies and gentlemen had abandoned the beautiful
gardens and curling paved walkways for home.  While the remnants of that
lost age linger in the perfectly shaped hedges, greenery and gardens of
tropical blooming plants, the monument of Andrew Jackson on a rearing horse
in black iron and the white face of the looming cathedral, litter and reek
fills the crevices between cobblestones, and rot creeps through the European
architecture.  The Saint Louis Cathedral rises some two hundred feet above
the square.  Cathedral bells chime regularly from the high towers, keeping
time with the mythically large white-faced clock that faces the square. 
Like in nights of old the Square is a hotspot for dealers, prostitutes,
musicians and vagrants, the lot of who flock to this underworld bazaar and
fill the benches, paths and steps before the cathedral with wares.  When the
sun rises they will be gone, but after dark this place belongs only to the
underworld.

#eAn Expansive Warehouse #w-#e Main Room#n~
Stepping into this warehouse, one is assaulted with the very classic
sense of New Orleans' district for housing them.  The walls are bare, devoid
of all decoration save for a few rather large #wpaintings#n, one on each
wall.  To the west can be seen a set of steel stairs, which lead to a
second-floor walkway which has been crafted of the same metal, it's expanse
leading around the entire perimeter of the room's boundaries, and running
it's path under a row of dirt-laden windows which do quite the same, broken
only by an unmarked door.  Sitting off to the side of the room can be seen a
small table with four chairs, covered with a varietyof tools for arts that
range from painting and sketching, to even sculpting.  The real attraction
in this massive work of architecture are the assortmentof #Cstatues#n that
have been scattered around in no particular patternism.  Against the eastern
wall is a rather tall ladder that's been bolted in for security, and scales
all the way up to the ceiling, where it can be seen to end at a decent-sized
hatch leading to the roof.  The hatch is barred shut.  A few other things of
no great import are strewn here and there as well, a grand stereo system in
one corner of the room, a large-screened television near it, flanked by two
plush chairs.

statues~
Along the length of this room's walls are statues of the most horrible
sort, with a few even scattered out in spaces on the more open floor.  Some
are finished, some are not, but all are sick and twisted, to put it lightly.
From the exoticly arousing to the exoticly horrid, they range from topics so
pleasing to the eye as women in the nude, to a more mild form of disgusting,
to even the most foul and grotesque demons and monsters, leaking from
never-moving pustules, and torturing souls that always scream, but never
make a sound.  
~
E
paintings~
Four paintings grace this room, one on each wall, and all of them rather
large.  Three of them are noticeably the work of h@kk(3d) himself, as they
denote a darker undertone and the natural sense of morbid humour that is so
often found in works that are related to him.  The first a nude woman, the
second a pack of dogs which are feasting from the stomach of a screaming
male, and the third a jester that is being hanged.  The last painting,
however, lies on the eastern wall and obviously did not share the same
creator as the first three.  Several people are trapped in the imagery, a
group painting, as it were.  All of them are dressed in fine clothing, suits
and dresses, and all are standing together.  They look more like a family,
than anything.

#eAn Expansive Warehouse #w-#e Bedroom#n~
A short trip through a rather darkened hall has brought you into a room
that is so much more lavish than the main part of the warehouse.  There is
nothing like a window at all in this small sanctuary, but the sheer and
undeniable amount of creature comforts is more than enough to make up for
the lack of a view.  The floor has been covered with a plush and very soft
carpet of dark black, and is clean to a fault.  In the center of the
northern wall can be seen a rather massive, four-poster bed with a canopy on
it and graced with near transparent curtains of a material that matches the
carpet, though off to the side has been leaned a very elegant looking
coffin, near upright, and bearing on it's front the polished and inlaid
design of a black gothic cross which has been outlined in a glimmering
silver, the unmistakeable trademark of gypsies, tramps, and thieves the
world around.  If the rest of the room is a facade of elegance and
pampering, then the contents of the eastern wall are a real sign of the
eccentricity that is sure to follow.  The whole of the barrier has been
decorated with taped photographs, most of people who are all familiar to the
nightlife of New Orleans, and even some with shorthanded notes scrawled here
and there, revealing this or that about certain aspects.  Very few of them
seem as if they were aware of the impromptu photo shoots.  Unlike other
rooms in this domain, this one is absolutely devoid of anything that could
be considered a real or respected form of art, aside from the
stalker-quality pictures.  A rather elegant table of oak resides against the
south wall, kept far from anything else.  Upon it rests a leatherbound book
and a single photograph of a copper-haired, supernaturally beautiful woman,
along with a Sabbat Ankh, and a certain arrangement of instruments, from an
antique goblet and athame, to a black set of prayer beads with an attached
symbol hanging from them -- the same that can be found on the coffin's face.

#rPirate Alley, Madison Street#n~
Buildings loom up three stories on both sides of the alley, displaying
classic wrought iron double balconies with hanging ferns.  The infamous
cobblestoned alley is the subject of much legend and lore, some true, and
much false.  Some claim that it was a haven for dueling pirates in days
past, while others claimed that slaves were sold at the adjacent St. 
Anthony's Garden on Royal Street.  The much photographed "Pirate's Alley"
lamppost's illumination does not extend too far down into the alley in the
evening; the area has a mystique and slightly foreboding atmosphere at this
time of the night.  Due to the darkness the alley is sparsely populated. 
While Jackson Square is dark, it holds nothing on the humid blackness
filling this walkway.  Vines pregnant with flowers choke the walls, gates
and shops, unchecked and wild as they push through plaster, brick and
pavement.  A small bookstore is to the north, the staircase to the door
cuddled inbetween two boarded windows.  #pArcadian Books & Prints#n is
printed on the unlit sign. To the east a shop that the eye slides over
easier than not reads #pYesteryears #nin a curling, old-timey font.

#eAn Expansive Warehouse #w- #eRooftop#n~
This rooftop is large, to be sure!  The entire length is flat, just
perfect for whatever someone might have in mind.  It offers a three-hundred
and sixty degree view of New Orleans' warehouse district, as well as some
other parts of the western side of the City that Care Forgot, along with the
presence of the mighty Mississippi that flows off in the distance, a
writhing pathway of brown water.  There's nothing special about this roof at
all.  A hatch that leads back down, a table and some chairs, and off to one
side of the area, some photographic equipment that's been set up and meant
for a photo shoot.  The western side of the rooftop holds a fire-escape
which gives the easiest escape route down to the ground from up here. 
That's about it for the roof.

#wJackson Square (Avg. NPCs: 22)#n~
Surrounded by a massive iron-wrought fence still standing from the city's
French Colonial origins, Jackson Square was once a hub of elegance at the
center of the Quarter; an echo of an time long faded, where the homeless
would gather after dusk to interact and sleep under the light of the tall
iron lamps, long after ladies and gentlemen had abandoned the beautiful
gardens and curling paved walkways for home.  While the remnants of that
lost age linger in the perfectly shaped hedges, greenery and gardens of
tropical blooming plants, the monument of Andrew Jackson on a rearing horse
in black iron and the white face of the looming cathedral, litter and reek
fills the crevices between cobblestones, and rot creeps through the European
architecture.  The Saint Louis Cathedral rises some two hundred feet above
the square.  Cathedral bells chime regularly from the high towers, keeping
time with the mythically large white-faced clock that faces the square. 
Like in nights of old the Square is a hotspot for dealers, prostitutes,
musicians and vagrants, the lot of who flock to this underworld bazaar and
fill the benches, paths and steps before the cathedral with wares.  When the
sun rises they will be gone, but after dark this place belongs only to the
underworld.

#eAn Expansive Warehouse #w- #eSupplies#n~
Dropping down through the trapdoor in the floor of the main room has
brought you into a very confusing supplies room.  While one side is more
than normal, filled with chisels, hammers, easels, paintbrushes, canvas, and
all manner of odds and ends for an aspiring artist, the other half of the
room is just about the complete opposite.  The walls are hung with things
such as coils of rope, racks of walkie-talkies, a few pairs of night-vision
goggles, as well as holstered nine millimeter pistols, and an extensive
display of sharpened knives and daggers, with the occasional machete popping
up too.  This is very obviously the supplies room for someone who is leading
a double life, or at the very least, someone who is into the more exotic
hobbies found in life.  The walls are all re-inforced steel, and the room is
light up with tracks of flourescent lighting, giving the place a rather
'down-to-business' feeling.

`wLibrary`n~
Curved shelves composed of arched, sleek matte steel beams line the walls
of this massive, perfectly oval room completely, save for the opening that
gives way to an open, broad Gothic arch in black marble to the south.  Tomes
beyond count fill the shelves from top to bottom, leaving no space open for
storage of anything else upon the beams.  The floors are composed of wood in
the deepest cherry red, sanded perfectly smooth and fitted together with
narrow, interlocking square panels.  Squat four-legged chairs with plush
scarlet or black cushions are placed here and there throughout the ballroom
sized library, with small curling iron-tables topped in surfaces no larger
than a dinner plate.  Modern styled sconces in thin glass descend several
dozen feet from the vaulted ceilings, casting a warm glow throughout the
library suitable for reading in all hours in the night.  Iron ladders
attached in places to the shelves can be slid throughout the room, so that
the upper shelves that lie at twenty five or more feet from the ground may
be accessed.

Empty Condo~
There is a large, warm-brown colored sectional and some cream-colored
easy chairs forming a cozy U-shape to the left that first draws one's
attention in the room.  A patterned rug in shades of brown and tan on the
hardwood floor is visible through a glass-top coffee table.  This appears to
be a perfect place for family and friends in the evenings.  Opposite the U
shape is a large entertainment and electronics center with all the modern
gadgets and all very neatly stored away behind a dark mahogony finish on the
unit.  Tall and gently arching chrome floor lamps can be adjusted for
reading and trac lighting is directed from the ceiling to vividly display
several bright paintings done by the same artist and gracing two of the rich
tan walls in this room.  To the right through an arch is a modern kitchen,
kept very clean, and straight away from the entrance door is a hallway
leading to the live-in housekeepers room and a bathroom.  Just to the left
of the hall are a set of stairs going upwards.

With a whimsical polka-dotted red and black carpet, this room appears to
be occupied most of the time by a lady-bug lover.  With the bright little
bugs appearing on the walls, the bed, even the walls and lampshade, the room
is an outdoor adventure for someone special.  A brightly painted desk on one
wall has a computer on it and a red laquer finish tv is on a low stand.  A
variety of dvd's and games scattered about near the tv indicate a variety of
learning interests by the 'bug' who lives here as well.  A sleek satin
pillow shaped like a ladybug sits at an angle in the middle of the bed,
propped against a wood headboard that has small winding 'trails' of flying
ladybugs all about it.  A small but neat closet is recessed into one wall
and the windows in the room are framed by netting and ladybug curtains.  The
far corner has a play area within it, complete with a play kitchen, food,
pots, pans, and some plastic chairs, with a tiny table for 'tea'.

The master bedroom is a statment in simple elegance.  The large king-size
bed has an arched golden oak headboard and rich earthy tones in the matched
curtains, comforter and bedskirt.  Two comfortable arm-chairs with
footstools are angled next to a small table with a lamp upon it and the wall
next to the chairs opens to a large closet with built in drawers.  A
television-dvd/vhs combination unit sits within what looks like an armoir of
the same golden oak color as the headboard, once closed no one could tell
what the contents were.  A thick pile of soothing golden, brown and earth
tones makes up the carpeting and a master bath can be glimpsed with its
large tub and gleaming tiles through a door near the bed.

A matching computer desk and underdrawer storage units is pressed into
the far corner of this home office.  A larger bookshelf and hutch off to one
side is also of matching decor.  The floor is carpeted but there is a large
chair mat at the work area for ease in moving from computer, to phone, to
desktop.  A large bulletin board is on one wall, with various diagrams,
papers, notes and postings upon it.  A collection of books, some of military
history, handbooks and patriotic themes are mixed with novels, and medical
books upon the shelves.  The windows are shuttered and barred with a small
decorative wrought iron terrace just outside of them.  Upon the top shelf of
the bookcase is a picture of two GI's standing in front of a barracks with
sloppy grins on their faces and arms about each other's shoulders.  A small
shadow box displays various pins, bars and medals against a dark blue
background.

`cLiving Room`n~
Entering into this room is stepping into a world of monochromatic refined 
dignity and taste.  The living room is partly sunken, the rest or the room 
forming a six foot walkway on three sides.  The sunken living room has a 
black leather manhattan style couch, that frames on two sides, a glass 
topped ebony table.  A pure white, hand knotted rya rug covers the whole 
of the floor in ankle deep luxury.  A pair of chairs, matching the couch, 
face it across the table, each with it's own small side table of polished 
steel and glass.  The upper section of the room is floored in black, 
silver veined marble, as are the stairs that lead down to the main expanse 
of the living room.  The walls are pure white, and unadorned.  The left 
hand side of the room is a kitchen nook and standing breakfast bar, which 
continues the color scheme.  The countertops are black marble, the 
appliances steel.  In the right hand corner of the room is a freestanding 
piece of modern art, a slightly twisted six foot tall length of burnished 
steel with beveled edges.  The far wall of the room is taken up by a built 
in home entertainment center complete with an automatic sliding door that 
matches the surrounding walls perfectly.

This room continues the display of the dignity and style of its owner. 
All four walls are filled bookshelves, the occupants providing the room 
with the warm scent of old leather.  The focal point of the room is an 
antique letter table, with a matching leather padded chair.  There are 
also two additional chairs set in front of the table, these are noticably 
lacking in cushions.  On the table is a blotter, inkwell and quill set, 
and a closed ledger.  Also on the desk, and the only jarring object in 
the room, is a modern phone.

#pArcadian Books & Prints#n~
The atmosphere of the Arcadian is one of warmth and welcome, the first
thing greeting one's senses upon entering an intriguing mingling of fresh
lavender and harvest spices, as though a pumpkin pie were cooling on an
unseen windowsill.  The lighting is dim enough to promote a sense of
intimacy, while still illuminating the various goods and sundries to be
found on countless shelves and within wood and glass display cases.  Just to
the right inside the door, an invitingly plush sofa in burgundy velvet
stands flanked by two overstuffed chairs, offering cozy seating for the
patrons of the shop.  Built into every wall are seemingly endless shelves,
providing homes for everything from books on voodoun and the occult, the
tarot, crystals, dream interpretation and so on, to a wide selection of
handmade candles in a vast array of scents.  Glass vials and small clay pots
bear products ranging from salves advertised to promote healing, a more
youthful appearance, to oils - both perfumed and essential.  Crystals of
various sizes and types can be found nearby a display case cradling an
impressive selection of jewelry, many pieces hand-crafted and one of a kind.
Less prominent though still carefully - almost lovingly - displayed here and
there about the shop are various works of art, both paintings and statuary. 
Dried herbs, resins and flowers of nearly every kind can be found on yet
more shelves near the back counter, which houses such miscellaneous things
as a few athames and bolines, a bone rune stone set, a cauldron and a small
stuffed teddy bear.  Often seen prowling or lounging about is a black
domestic cat with a single patch of white fur at its chest.  Its luminous
green eyes seem alert and attentive, the creature friendly, for the most
part.

`cMaster Bedroom`n~
This is the owners sanctum sanctorium, the place where he feels free to 
let down his guard, and to be himself.  The large four poster canopied bed 
is the center piece of the room, it's sheets are dark purple and silken, 
and the pillows are satin and black.  The coverlet is of a nubby, heavy 
silk like material, of the same hue as the pillows.  The wall at the head 
of the bed has a pair of brackets built in on which rests an empty curved 
scabbard.  The ankle deep carpeting is black, with royal purple highlights.  
A door to the left leads to a large walk-in closet.  A pair of bookshelves 
flank the door, their antique providence belying the modern contents.  A 
pair of dressers, matching the bed, rest against opposite walls, each with 
large attached mirrors positioned such that, while looking into one, your 
back can be seen in the other.  At the foot of the bed is an antique 
footchest.  In the far right corner of the room is a small roll top desk, 
the cover down, and a black leather office chair drawn up to it.

#pArcadian Books & Prints, Basement Workshop#n~
This large, open space has obviously been set up for use as a workshop,
though it still somehow maintains an inviting appeal, a sense of cozy
warmth.  Oak shelves are stocked with innumerable supplies, both to restock
the shop out front and to craft many of the items found therein.  Metals,
gemstones and crystals, wax and wicks, oils and herbs and resins, all this
and more can be found neatly organized and within reach of their
corresponding tools and equipment.  A large work table stands near the
center of the room, fashioned to house a number of drawers for supplies and
tools.  Hardwood flooring is kept clean and polished, with additional
lighting beyond the ambient available for tasks that require such.  In one
corner, a canvas rests upon an easel facing the room, paints and brushes
standing ready nearby.  A pottery wheel is set up nearby, along with a small
kiln for firing the products finished upon it.  A small desk stands against
the wall to the right, neatly organized and allowing this room to serve as
an office, as well.  At the back, a set of stairs angles upwards to the shop
floor.

`cSecond Bedroom`n~
As opposed to the refined classical elegance of the rest of the house, 
this room has been decorated in an entirely different way.  While the 
furnishings are still expensive, and tasteful, they do jar somewhat with 
the rest of the home.  The size of this room is difficult to guess, many 
folding screens most with images of chinese poppies decorating them, 
sectioning off areas.  The room is dimly lit by lower wattage bulbs, that 
are further dampened by lengths of thin dark fabric that sweep across the 
ceiling.  There is a futon like pedestal bed upon which are strewn a host 
of brightly colored blankets and pillows.  The top of a large teak wardrobe, 
with a carved poppie on the doors can be seen in one corner, over some of 
the screens.  At the foot of the bed is a teak chest, not entirely closed, 
that has clothing of various sorts hanging out.   A tea table occupies the 
corner near the door, with a large incense burner on top of it.

#wThe Saint Louis Cathedral#n~
The solemn feeling of this two-hundred-year-old building is overwhelming.  
The roof rises high, and the Spanish-style architecture is evident to the 
trained eye.  The masonry-covered stucco is well tended, as are the pews 
and other articles in the nave.  The main altar is made from a large piece 
of oak, and above it on the wall is a spectacular painting of St.  Louis
proclaiming the Seventh Crusade from the steps of Notre Dame. The grand 
room is lit by the sun, as it shines through the stained-glass windows, as 
well as other windows along the walls, slightly lower.  The sunlight that 
illuminates the stained-glass windows bring out the images presented 
there.  They are of St.  Louis at various stages of his life and 
canonization.  The awe that these holy works infer is sometimes staggering,
as each piece of glass has it's own tale to tell.  To the left of the altar,
against the wall, are the small confessionals.  Across from them, on the
opposite wall, are rows upon rows of candles in a side chapel for St. 
Louis.  There are a few people here, scattered amongst the pews, praying,
weeping, or just sitting collecting their thoughts.  A large umbrella is
stored in a glass case here as well.  A small sign on the case proclaims,
"In case of emergency, break glass."

`PA`ppartment B`P,`p Bedroom#n~
With walls painted a passionate shade of pink and crown moulding painted
black, the bedroom starts off shocking the eyes.  The bed is pushed right up
against a dark wood bookshelf, the shelves packed with some literature and
manuscript books, a locking beige trunk with brass latches, a water bottle,
an iron with the cord wrapped around its handle and a few mason jars
rattling with pens and number two pencils.  The bed is a twin size with a
comfortable number of boldly colored circular pillows tossed at the head. 
The blankets are two in number, one draped right on top of the other, one
orange and the other black.  There is a wide window looking out toward Royal
Street hanging with tiger-striped curtains with a hanging trim of black
drop-beads.  A wire line drapes from the high corner of one wall to the
other, and from it clothespins secure easily a hundred postcards, sketches,
pictures and other visually stimulating keepsakes in a low-hanging arc.  A
squat 70s style chair in vibrant sky blue sits right below the window, and a
small table beside it with books and a small telescope littering its
surface.  The floor is the same worn-out pine wood as the living room, and
overhead an opaque fixture sheds cooled light on the room.

#pDecatur Street at Jackson Square#n~
Lamps line the street, standing outside the many closed shops and stores.
Windows display burglar bars as well as warning signs for security systems. 
The occasional bum strolls by, begging for anything he can get.  The litter
upon the ground sits as a silent reminder that nobody watches this part of
town, nobody cleans it, and nobody protects those who pass through.  Jagged
alleys and side-shooting streets are layered through Decatur.  Pink and
yellow buildings loom up three stories on both sides of the street,
displaying classic wrought iron double balconies with hanging ferns.  Thick
cypress trees are crammed between buildings on every corner.  The branches
are suffocated under layers of lacey Spanish moss.

`PA`ppartment B`P,`p Guest Room#n~
The guest bedroom is comfortable and colorful, with a bed pushed under
the window and a few bookshelves against the red walls.  The window has
cheery orange curtains, and the sill has a couple framed photographs propped
upon it.  The bed is a twin fitted with black cotton sheets and a thick
blanket with a bright red and black argyle pattern.  A floppy velveteen
rabbit with long ears sits upright against the pillows at the head.  The
bookshelves contain the majority of the household's literature, housing the
complete sets of time-worn books and endless new paperbacks for perusal;
there are even a few novels by Hailey Harvey intermingled with the rest,
given no special placement.  This is the only room in the house with a
television, and the flat screen is mounted straight onto the wall with a
wicker cabinet containing DVDs, music and a couple old VHS tapes beneath it.
There is a faded string friendship bracelet pinned to inside of the door
with a glossy red thumbtack.

`rApartment C - Living Room`n~
Soft colors and comfort seem to be the main theme of this room, obviously
the living room.  A deep purple shag carpet blankets most of the floor, and
in the spots it doesn't, there is a rich mahaghony wood floor.  The walls
are a muted yellow color, keeping the tone of the room rather mellow and
smooth.  A large sectional sofa sits in the center of the room before a flat
screen LCD TV.  A large fern is in the corner, quite alive and vibrant
compared to the rest of the room.

`rApartment C - Kitchen`n~
The kitchen of the apartment seems to be the least used room of the
house.  The peeling white paint on the walls is covered in a layer of dust,
and the sinks look as if they haven't been used in ages.  The refridgerator
looks like the only thing that may have been used recently, and many
colorful letter magnets adorn it, spelling out the message, "Fuck you."  The
smooth and cool linoleum floor is dusty as well, and the odd spider wanders
across the floor.

#rCourtyard, The #RS#raint Phillips Apartments #R(#rAvg NPCs#R:#r3#R)#n~
A stereotypical French Quarter courtyard in a combination of French
Creole and Spanish styles.  The apartments are independent from one another,
sharing the courtyard, gardens, and laundry facilities, but nothing else. 
Singular apartment homes lie on each side of the courtyard, with the gate to
the north leading onto Royal.

`bApartment A `B-`b Living Room and Kitchen`n~
The walls in this modern apartment are of pristine white stucco,
complimented by a rich, brand new royal blue carpeting that spans from wall
to wall.  Empty boxes are piled neatly in one corner, collapsed in by design
to take up the least amount of space possible.  A squashy brown sofa sits
against one wall, with a squat, burnished oak coffee table stood between it
and a medium-sized, polished wood entertainment center containing a
television, stereo and DVD player in matching matte silver.  Their
respective remote controls lie in order on the coffee table, beside a solid
blue glass bowl filled with cashews.  A wide-bladed ceiling fan lazily
pushes air about the room, complete with a glowing light fixture enclosed by
frosted glass.  There is a white door with a highly polished brass knob on
the eastern, southern and northern walls.  Heavy blue curtains in some kind
of thick velvet fabric have been draped from the sole window, which is a
wide, bay style, mounted in the wall opposite the entertainment center.  The
kitchen is tiled in very clean, eggshell white with new, exceptionally
modern fixtures and a flat, electric stove-top.  A full set of sixteen
chef's knives sit upright, embedded traditionally into their wooden stand. 
A tall black, vertical doored fridge opens to reveal a sparse selection of
edibles, mostly a meld between beer of various brands and soda.

in classic goth loiter outside the eastern entrance in rising clouds of
clove cigarette smoke.  To the south the colored awnings of #rThe French

entering the area.

`bApartment A`B -`b Master Bedroom`n~
The master bedroom is much like every other room in the apartment in that
it has pristine white stucco walls and a rich, brand new royal blue
carpeting, though different in that it is the approximate size of all of
them put together.  The sheer volume of the room would be difficult for even
a person with hordes of furniture to fill, and the sparse array of items
currently present hardly manage to prevent an echo.  The ceilings are a
little higher than in the living room, the window sealed with a fitted
shutter and thick navy blue curtains in some heavy velvet material.  A large
chest of drawers in solid, burnished oak is flush to one wall, with a simple
stout desk lamp placed atop it, capable of being coaxed into life by the tug
of a dog tag chain.  The bed is simple, large and wholly functional, set
with comfortable cotton sheets, a single comforter and one pillow, all in
varying shades of blue.  A vintage gunmetal military trunk sits at the foot
of the bed, snugly closed by the attached leather straps and clasps.

Poorly maintained streets make vehicular travel down Esplande beneficial
for local automotive shops.  There are numerous pot holes - holes often

stretch of road.  The lack of law enforcement is particularly evident in the
brazen locations of graffiti; elsewhere an "artist" might want to find a
side or back wall.  Here they paint over the faces of buildings - those
directed at traffic.  Everything from "Fuck America!"  To less dignified
messages are sprayed onto the walls, mingled with makeshift murals of more
significant talent.  Bars line every window and snug Spanish courtyards seal
every home and business away.  The sidewalks are as crooked and spotted with
holes as the road.  A pool of grayish street light brightens the pavement
every fifteen yards.  A simple black sign with purple letters advertises
#pRings of Desire#n, a famous local piercing parlor in a modest building.

Pure white porcelain fixtures, clean black tiled walls and floors and a
large mirror full-length mirror mounted across the entire the wall above the
deep, clean sink are the main aspects of notice in this generously sized
bathroom.  A very deep, shell-shaped bathtub of black marble scoops into the
floor, equipped with jets that shoot hot water or bubbles and and a built-in
padded chair.  The temperature of the bath can be adjusted by a small panel
encased by marigold-stained wood panelling.  A seperate shower with a
waterfall fixture as opposed to the traditional diagonal fixture sits snug
in the farthest corner from the door, built with a polished steel towel rack
on the frosted glass door.

`bApartment A`B -`b Second Bedroom`n~
Three sets of sturdy, adult-sized bunkbeds have been set up in this room,
which, like the other rooms in the apartment, possesses pristine white
stucco walls and a rich, brand new royal blue carpeting from wall to wall. 
Five of the comfortable mattresses lie in some state of use, be they
occupied, messily abandoned or neatly made.  The sixth bunk is an untouched,
naked white box spring and mattress.  The populated beds are each set with
some form of sheets, blankets and pillows, the most lavish of which
possesses scarlet silk sheets cool to the touch, a thick black down coverlet
and a small pile of silk-slipped pillows at the head; the most spare is
little more than a white cotton sheet slipped across the top of the
mattress, a hotel blanket and an uncased, though very clean, pillow. 
Personal effects fill this room more than the others, the bedframes being
draped with cast-aside masculine clothing items, bottles of Old Spice or Axe
filing across the top of the large oak dresser, and a closet with one or two
extra pairs of boots or shoes, what would appear to be athletic equipment
and a gun safe stowed neatly inside it.

`PA`ppartment B`P,`p St`P.`p Phillips Apartments`n~
The walls are freshly painted a vibrant sky blue, contrasting the pumpkin
orange curtains over the living room and kitchen windows.  Lively ivy plants
hang down from the ceiling, the green leaves accented by their natural white
patterns and spilling in wispy tendrils over the sides of the light pots. 
The sofa is beige and worse for wear, but so comfortable bodies melt into it
like butter, with a burgundy afghan-knit blanket flung over one arm.  Across
from the sofa is a floral patterned wingback chair straight out of the 1940s
with a squashy throw pillow nuzzled in, and between the two places to sit is
a small fireplace, the cement tiles painted an offensive pink and the mantle
littered with a ceramic bust of a scotty dog, an ink sketch of a spanish
bull, novelty cups, an artfully painted skateboard, oddiments and
photographs and white twinkle lights strung through the lot with ornaments
hanging from the wire.  The floor is worn-out pine wood, clean if old.  A
kitchen takes up an L-shaped cut of the room, made bright by the long window
over the sink.  More potted plants hang down from the top of the
refrigerator, fragrant and flowering with yellow, and magnets clutter the
fridge doors with pamphlets, notes, concert tickets and all else stuck
beneath them.

The bedroom of the apartment seems to be one half-bedroom, another half
S&M dungeon.  Numerous bondage implements line the walls, all sorts of
different toys, some tame, some strange, some almost inconceivable.  Several
chains and shackles line the walls, including one hanging directly above the
bed.  The bed is a rather simple affair, though large.  It looks to be a
double-king size, with quite a few pillows and dark crimson sheets.

#GA Workshop#n~
If the actual shop itself is boring, and the epitome of clean, the area
for work in the next room is quite the polar opposite.  There cannot be a
single piece of equipment in this room that is in one piece, and everything
has been reduced to wires and parts, or gears and mechanisms.  The northern
wall is covered with a full-length bookcase, and this furnishing is
absolutely laden with books from A to Z on mechanical and electrical
knowledge in the field of Engineering, with titles that tackle the arts of
computer coding tossed in here and there.  In the center of the room is a
rather large table that has been covered with a mishmash of tools, both
those that are normal, and those for the specialist.  Just as the front
shop, this area as well has been lit bright by the presence of
track-lighting, giving it a professional look and feel, if not making it
seem a bit much like being in an office.  To the east and the west are each
a door, leading off into two seperate rooms.  In the corner of the room, up
near the ceiling, can be found a flickering screen, it's feed being that of
the shop to the south, and it's going-ons.

hangs near the rafters of the ceiling above the stools and small towers of

of the Eire dear to it's heart.

#wIntersection of Royal Street and Esplande Avenue#n~
Elegant wrought iron posts case bright lamps down the Royal Street
sidewalks, separated by the width of majestic old-growth cypress trees. 
Bollards painted with the New Orleans colors line the edges of the sidewalks
on both sides of the street.  The buildings here range in size and shape,
though they are all cleanly and respectable, old but not decrepit; antiques
beloved by the city.  The New Orleans Police Department make unusually
regular patrols down Royal Street, which keeps the lower echelons of society
mostly clear of the area.  There are ladies of the evening, but they'll set
a customer back thousands for an hour of her time; the drug dealers wear

no less populous but infinitely more difficult to detect.

#oA Wooded Trail#n~
The thickly crowded trees and tall bushes appear to thin slightly in this
area of the nature trail.  Some rock #cbenches#n, with a fine finish upon
them have been placed around a small clearing so adventurers along this
#Cmoss#n draped, sweet smelling path can sit and enjoy the small animals and
birds that flourish here.  Faint chitters and tweets along with scratching
and rustling of leaves within the ground cover all combine with the gurgling
of the #Bbrook#n flowing through to enclose the passerby in a world of peace
and beauty.  Bright #yblooms#n peek out from damp mossy beds under the shade
of trees and bush alike.  The utter stillness and serenity of this small
bubble of paradise is only broken by the caress of a soft breeze or a far
distant roll of gentle thunder.

A profusion of color splashes in complimentary shades, greeting the eye with

#rChartres Street#n~
Dark green pillars line the streets, supporting the terraces that hang
over the sidewalk.  Long fronds of plants spill down from the balconies,
pale green and spotted with the gauzy stalks of lavender.  Many of the
buildings date back to New Orleans' Colonial origins, made from brick that
helped them survive the many fires.  Towering over this antiqued district
are the tips of modern skyscrapers, centered around the western skyline. 
Restaurants and cafes are common, but nightclubs and unique jazz venues
dominate the streets.  The succulent scents of bubbling and roasting Cajun
cuisine and dark coffees brewing fill the humid air.

television announcing room extras and video games, web access and pay movies

`gClearing in the Cypress`n~
Visible through the thick cypress and willow branches that swallow
completely even the brightest rays of moonlight is a moderately
large, two-story wooden shack with woodframed, paneless windows
and walls that appear to be holding up by sheer will alone. Despite
the age of the building - being obviously from the now long past
days, when the wealthy plantation owners required housing for slaves
and would oftentimes have one of these shacks constructed - it would
appear to still be in use, and a small, obviously homemade windchime
hangs from the rough rafter above the missing door.

#wIntersection of Chartres and Ursulines Street#n~
Parked cars line the street on both sides, creating an even more cramped
space for passage down the notoriously narrow road.  Tucked in behind the
rows of parked cars are the sidewalks.  Dappled shadows hang over the
walkway, thrown by the crossed branches of trees thick with Spanish moss. 
Many of the trees are cypress, and older than New Orleans.  Elegant stoops
on flat-faced buildings flank the sidewalks.  Pots of ferns and wisps of
flowering greenery dangle from iron balconies overhead.  A few estates are
nuzzled safely into locked gates on Spanish courtyards, with house numbers
on the walls outside to imply a state of residence.  The antique streetlamps
characteristic of the older portions of New Orleans are present here.

The floor is littered with leaves, soil, and bits of dried jasmine
or other random foliage. The walls are covered in poorly done graffiti;
pictures, words, warnings, all done in spraypaint or chalk. Doors that
appear to be no more than slabs of wood set before the frames close off
rooms on each side of the hallway, and the exit to the south has no

building. An old, molded and vine overgrown ladder leads into a hole in

of private residences.  Buildings painted pastel colors house multiple
residents in apartment complexes.  Iron balconies dangle potted plants over

Rebellious plants grow through the spaces in the pavement, struggling to

Earth toned brickwork towers over Canal Street; buildings specifically
designed for granduer in an age now gone.  Modern skyscrapers tower higher
than their older, more dignified companions.  New restaurants, apartment
complexes and fresh corporate offices are built behind facades intended to
make them look older, but they still stick out like sore thumbs; anything
new is obvious in the French Quarter and Canal Street is no exception.  Even
with its five lane road and heavy traffic it's in New Orleans, and New
Orleans is antiqued je ne se quais.  Roaming youths, staggering street
ladies, barely concealed homeless and overflowing alleys reveal the culture
that exists in the moonlight, even if the polish on modern Canal Street
would prefer to ignore it.  The police precinct is to the south through a
large sandstone archway.  #BNew Orleans Police Department#n is carved into
the arch, and the letters are painted black.

`eMaster Chamber`n~
Lavish old furnishings, most likely Italian, delicate yet ornamented, are
mingled in with modern luxaries everywhere in this massive room.  A gilded
four-poster bed, hung with gauzy curtains and covered with down pillows and
draperies of silk is near flush to the far northern wall.  A thick white
carpet conceals the old wood flooring.  There is a dressing table littered
with glittering jars and silver objects, and a curious old-fashioned white
telephone.  Velvet chairs; a monster of a telvision set and shelves of
stereo music equipment; and small polished tables everywhere, strewn with
newspapers, books and remarkable pieces of artwork that never quite made it
to the walls.  A pair of heavy wooden doors lie within a far niche, and past
them is a passage which turns sharply into an L.  Beyond the bend lies a
sarcophagus with a plain lid that has been fashioned ot of diorite.  The lid
is immensely heavy, and upon examination it could be discerned that it is
plated in iron, and contains a bolt that can be slipped from within. 
Several glittering objects lie on the bottom of the box itself, and they
sparkle almost magically in the light that leaks in from the gas-lit main
chamber.  There is a golden mask, its features carefully molded, the lips
closed, the eye holes narrow but open, attached to a hood made up of layered
plates of hammered gold.  There is a pair of leather gloves covered
completely in tinier more delicate gold plate like scales, and finally a
large folded blanket of the softest red wool with one side sewn with larger
gold plates.  The mask itself could remind one only of the Greek masks of
comedy and tragedy, and the rest of the burial of some ancient royal.

letters worn off, and even a small rattle with a missing handle. A few
rotting apple cores sit piled in a corner, along with several empty bags
of food.

A small outshoot of concrete perhaps five paces in total length holds
tightly to the remnants of another sewer catwalk, serving as the entrance to
a large, somewhat spherical room.  In the distance, one could spot another
bit of concrete meant to hold the other end, however, the wretched thing has
rusted loose and snapped downward, plunging into a reservoir of surprisingly
still and dishearteningly black water.  Chains crisscross the bit of catwalk
still attached to concrete, held fast by rusting padlocks.  The only warning
sign is a graffiti-ed '#RTHE GREAT BELOW#n' on the nearest wall.

From floor to ceiling in this dimly lit room is black matte finished
metal and hard plastic, lined with buttons, screens in black and white,
and handles. An entire wall is dedicated to survellience screens that
show views of the outer door of Warren, the catwalk bridges, and anything
that so much as moves in the Antechamber, those cameras having obviously
been tuned to pick up and record movement.

`oA Gaping Maw of a Sewer Pipe`n~
The first thing visible, other than the perpetual trash and the occasional rat
skittering along the fringes, is a huge sewer pipe. Its gaping maw extends 
towards the doorway east, and even from here an observant eye could note the 
fact that it is choked with trash, sewage, and other undesirable substances 
whose origin would probably remain better nameless. This maw engulfs the entire 
western and southern corner of this room and seems to take up the majority of 
the space otherwise. The walls are chipping with filth, what appears to be 
caked blood, and something that could possibly be feces. A small, clean patch 
on the wall seems to be set up with a mic and reciever, and a small pad which 
allows for code input from its faintly blue-glowing numbers, when the sleek 
black cover is not flipped over the entire package. Along the edges of the maw 
seem to be slightly protruding metal pieces, indicating that the control could 
possibly be an emergency closing mechanism. Through a pair of closed,
electronic doors is a spiraling, filthy stone staircase that leads downward.

`oA Catwalk Bridge`n~
A half circle of solid brick that spans in an arc perhaps twenty feet from
top to bottom, the latter of which has two sections of cement a foot wide
that sit on opposite sides of an everflowing stream of dark waste and
water. The walls are damp and occasionally moisture beads together, forming
a droplet that slides down the brick to the cement sidings. A rickety
bridge of moisture-swelled wooden slats bound together by rope that also
acts as the 'hand-rails' on either sides hangs midair from the huge steel
exit to the north, and spans off on little offshoots every now and again 
into a cylindrical brick tower with a fittingly huge steel-enforced door.
The bridge leads downward, into a relative abyss of darkness not discernable 
from here. An offshoot to the west leads to a doorless pipe. A pair of 
hideously deformed guards stand at the entrance to the southern door.

#wIntersection of Royal and Ursulines Street#n~
Parked cars line the street on both sides, creating an even more cramped
space for passage down the notoriously narrow road.  Tucked in behind the
rows of parked cars are the sidewalks.  Dappled shadows hang over the
walkway, thrown by the crossed branches of trees thick with Spanish moss. 
Many of the trees are cypress, and older than New Orleans.  Elegant stoops
on flat-faced buildings flank the sidewalks.  Pots of ferns and wisps of
flowering greenery dangle from iron balconies overhead.  A few estates are
nuzzled safely into locked gates on Spanish courtyards, with house numbers
on the walls outside to imply a state of residence.  The antique streetlamps
characteristic of the older portions of New Orleans are present here.

#pRoyal Street#n~
Elegant wrought iron posts case bright lamps down the Royal Street
sidewalks, separated by the width of majestic old-growth cypress trees. 
Bollards painted with the New Orleans colors line the edges of the sidewalks
on both sides of the street.  The buildings here range in size and shape,
though they are all cleanly and respectable, old but not decrepit; antiques
beloved by the city.  The New Orleans Police Department make unusually
regular patrols down Royal Street, which keeps the lower echelons of society
mostly clear of the area.  There are ladies of the evening, but they'll set
a customer back thousands for an hour of her time; the drug dealers wear
designer clothes and know their customers by name, title, and address.  On
Royal Street the danger hides behind a mask of courtesy, where killers are
no less populous but infinitely more difficult to detect.

`oChamber of Horrors`n~
Passing between the two monsterous guards at the door, a short flight of 
stairs desends into a large, rather sunken circular chamber of earth. Liquid 
beads along the roof and sides, and the air is disgustingly humid due to the 
structure of the room itself. Wood and metal supports the walls, meeting at 
the peak of a dome at least eighteen feet above the floor. At first glance
the floor would appear flat, but closer examination reveals it to be lined
with hundreds of pits, used as anything from sleeping quarters to conference 
rooms. Rats skitter to and fro, seeming to have been assigned to keeping 
watch over the room. A raised platform towers over the rest of the room, 
being along the southern wall and pointing towards the only door. There is 
a thick, heavy steel box affixed to the middle of the platform, affixed with
the words '#RCAUTION`n'. To make sure the warning is heeded, a trio of twisted 
guards sit in chairs around the box, examining a series of monitors displaying 
various statistics, all of which rest atop a large, sturdy desk covered in 
locked drawers.

`oThe Catacombs`n~
Wide tunnels lead off in all directions from the steel door west. 
Instead of brick or stone, skulls have been stacked and crafted into
one another, forming the walls themselves or perhaps just built so as
to obstruct them entirely from view. Broad arches in the ceilings 
give way at their epicenter to hundreds upon thousands of deep, three
foot by three foot catacombs, several of which with stone pillows at
the heads or topmost spots. While still putrid and dripping with 
moisture, this series of catacombs with walls of holes intended for
the apparant resting place of corpses seems either more often
frequented or better taken care of by whatever occupies it, than the
rest of the tunnels.

#wToulouse Street#n~
The lamps of Toulouse are well-maintained and their light cool and pale
yellow.  Boutiques and other shops mingle with the closed Spanish courtyards
of private residences.  Buildings painted pastel colors house multiple
residents in apartment complexes.  Iron balconies dangle potted plants over
the street.  The sidewalks lining Toulouse are old and in places cracked. 
Rebellious plants grow through the spaces in the pavement, struggling to
reclaim the marsh from New Orleans.  Grills in the gutters loose clouds of
steam into the nighttime air.  To the west is the courtyard of #pThe Dungeon#n, 
sealed behind a great iron gate. A faint mist rises over the high stone 
walls of the famous club.

#CCanal Street#n~
Earth toned brickwork towers over Canal Street; buildings specifically
designed for granduer in an age now gone.  Modern skyscrapers tower higher
than their older, more dignified companions.  New restaurants, apartment
complexes and fresh corporate offices are built behind facades intended to
make them look older, but they still stick out like sore thumbs; anything
new is obvious in the French Quarter and Canal Street is no exception.  Even
with its five lane road and heavy traffic it's in New Orleans, and New
Orleans is antiqued je ne se quais.  Roaming youths, staggering street
ladies, barely concealed homeless and overflowing alleys reveal the culture
that exists in the moonlight, even if the polish on modern Canal Street
would prefer to ignore it.  In a spacious lot surrounded by parking garages
is a jarring slice of modern architecture; The heavy brickwork of #PHarrah's
New Orleans Casino#n masquerades as historic, coated with neon signs that
blaze around its multiple stories.

#pThe Forecourt#n~
A winding driveway leads from the black wrought iron gates at the front
of the estate towards the black double doors of the mansion itself, elegant
statues looming either side.  A large fountain stands in the middle of the
forecourt, covered in granite cherubs and young maids endlessly pouring from
pitchers while small sparrows play in the cool waters.  Small spotlights
surround the mansion itself, pointing upward to the rendered white walls and
making it seem much more ominous in the chill night air.  Several long black
cars wait silently at the end of the drive while light from the first floor
windows dance across their polished surfaces and the expansive gardens
beyond.  Several thin, wrought iron pillars hold up the second floor
balcony, intricate black latticework connecting them and continuing up onto
the rails of the balcony.  The large double doors that make up the entrance
to the mansion are dark and foreboding, with a large gothic "CC" carved into
the wood of each one.

#oIntersection of Canal and Bourbon Street#n~
Clubs and shops built into dignified old buildings line Bourbon Street
from end to end.  From the far reaches of clubs and bars innumerable, the
distant sound of drums is relentless and ominous; the only thing louder is
the cacophony of voices streaming through walls.  Hundreds of neon signs
beckon tourists to walk their way; the colors should be dazzling, but
something in the air - be it the sticky moisture or the smoke that fills it
- mutes their glow into cool, pastel hues.  The denizens of the shadows
watch from the alleys and terraces that flank the road, casting looming
silhouettes of darkness against the backdrop of the bustling strip. 
Glittering strings of beads are everywhere, and hordes of tourists pack the
sidewalks.  The gutters are spilling over with squelching fluids; anything
dropped on the ground is better left where it fell.  Cheap, potent alcohol
flows like water into cups that fill every hand, and people kneel or flop
onto the cobblestones to empty their stomachs into the gutters.  #cThe

#pFoyer of the Crone Mansion#n~
The black double doors open into a stunning foyer, the floors covered in
patterned white and magenta tiles and the walls a warm off white colour. 
Large paintings hang from the walls, each one depicting one of the great
thinkers of his time immortalised in oils.  A pair of staircases extend from
either side of the room up to the second level, meeting for a moment below
the largest of the paintings in the collection, a small brass plate
underneath reading "Baron Cimitiere."  Between the staircases, another large
set of double doors stands, leading out towards the rear of the mansion,
while smaller, less conspicuous doors lead to rooms both east and west of
the main foyer.  A large crystal chandelier ominously from the ceiling above
the floor, where another large gothic "CC" symbol lies at the very centre of
the pattern of tiles.

A large atrium stands at the rear of the mansion, the whole rear wall of the
room made up of folding glass doors that, when open, lead directly out into
the garden. The garden itself is, if anything, even more well tended than
the forecourt, with large trees, winding pathways, fountains, statues and
carefully arrange flower beds helping to give the garden an almost regal
appearance. In one corner of the garden sits a bird aviary, filled with
rather homely sparrows and doves, rather than the exotic birds that might be
expected. Finally, in the centre of the garden stands a large white gazebo,
hand carved roses decorating the pillars and walls of the octagonal
structure.

The two staircases lead onto a large landing, decorated with numerous

to resemble marble, and a large chandelier hangs quietly overhead.  Hanging
lights illuminate this room with a gentle glow, giving it a warm feeling
quite unlike the cold foyer below.  Hallways lead east and west from the
landing, the doors along their length leading to the numerous guest
bedrooms.  A large set of double doors stands at the end of the corridor to
the east, leading to the master bedroom, the doors themselves embossed with
the same ornate "CC" symbol that is mirrored throughout the mansion.

Behind the double doors stands the master bedroom, its white walls standing
in stark contrast to the black carpeting and dark purple drapes. A
four-poster bed sits in the centre of the room, the bedspread a deep purple
to match the drapes, and the dark wood engraved with small roses to mirror
the chest of draws against the south wall. A small door leads to the
connecting bathroom, while a larger set of glass pained double doors lead
out to the balcony to the east. One small desk sits in the corner of the
room with an open book on it, a quill and ink set sitting nearby.

This room is quite bare, lacking the elaborate decorations that the other
rooms make wide use of. The floor is covered in a thin black carpet with a
marble pattern, while the walls retain the warm off white colour that is
evident in most other rooms in the house. A long meeting table made from
glass and dark wood stands at the very centre of the room, large,
comfortable looking chairs extending down its length. At the head of the
table is another chair, but this one seems somewhat larger and more ornate
than the others, as if built to be imposing rather than to merely be a
comfortable place to sit. Large black vases and potted plants sit in the
corners and along the walls, adding a little decoration to an otherwise dull
room.

This room is quite large for a study, with elaborate paintings covering
the off white walls and black, marble patterned carpet covering the floor. 
In one corner sits a large mahogany desk, numerous books lying open on its
surface, while opposite that sits a black grand piano.  Next to the desk
looms a tall bookcase, heavy with dust and thick books, ranging from Finance
for Dummies to strange, leather-bound tombs without any title, only symbols
in silver leaf.  A crystal chandelier hangs from the ceiling in the centre
of this room as well, and a large fireplace sits on the northern side,
burning noisily in the otherwise silent room.  The white marble mantle above
it is decorated with pictures of family members, ranging from black and
white to colour, and above that sits a large plaque with a gothic "CC"
embossed onto it, two crossed rowan wands mounted on the wall just below.

A dark passage winds downwards from the secret entrance behind the
bookcase, leading towards a dank room that almost resembles a crypt.  Thick
wax candles of every colour illuminate the room, filling it with greasy
smoke that collects near the ceiling.  The room itself is mostly a drab
purple, although much of the paint has peeled and cracked to reveal the grey
concrete beneath, while other areas have been covered with occult symbols
painted in white.  In the very centre of the room stands a white circle,
surrounded by occult symbols that have been painted very intricately and
deliberately.  At the southern end of the room stands a few operating tables
near a pile of empty coffins, the floor here stained red with blood and the
occasional finger or tooth can be seen where it had fallen during any number
of rituals.

`bDocks over the Mississippi (Avg. NPCs: 54)`n~
Broad planks of swollen wood float on muddy currents, moving with the
sway of the river.  Vessels that range widely in size and worth are moored
to slips defined only by the space between posts.  A few rickety house boats
are squeezed in between industrial flatboats, shrimping and shipping
vessels.  Boat houses, little sturdier than shacks, fill the open spaces
down the docksides.  Night workers crowd and bustle about vessels and slips,
avoiding eye contact with passers-by or other strangers to the dockside
scene, though they seem plenty social with their coworkers.  Yellow dock
lights frame the walkway.

onto the cobblestones to empty their stomachs into the gutters.  Just to the
east, #rLaffite's Blacksmith Shop#n offers up the light sounds of the piano
playing within.

`bDocks over the Mississippi (Avg. NPCs: 54)`n~
Broad planks of swollen wood float on muddy currents, moving with the
sway of the river.  Vessels that range widely in size and worth are moored
to slips defined only by the space between posts.  A few rickety house boats
are squeezed in between industrial flatboats, shrimping and shipping
vessels.  Boat houses, little sturdier than shacks, fill the open spaces
down the docksides.  Night workers crowd and bustle about vessels and slips,
avoiding eye contact with passers-by or other strangers to the dockside
scene, though they seem plenty social with their coworkers.  Yellow dock
lights frame the walkway.

#wEsplande Avenue#n~
Poorly maintained streets make vehicular travel down Esplande beneficial
for local automotive shops.  There are numerous pot holes - holes often
disguised by puddles of rain and mud.  After sunset no police patrol this
stretch of road.  The lack of law enforcement is particularly evident in the
brazen locations of graffiti; elsewhere an "artist" might want to find a
side or back wall.  Here they paint over the faces of buildings - those
directed at traffic.  Everything from "Fuck America!"  to less dignified
messages are sprayed onto the walls, mingled with makeshift murals of more
significant talent.  Bars line every window and snug Spanish courtyards seal
every home and business away.  The sidewalks are as crooked and spotted with
holes as the road.  A pool of grayish street light brightens the pavement
every fifteen yards.

Parked cars line the street on both sides, creating an even more cramped
space for passage down the notoriously narrow road.  Tucked in behind the
rows of parked cars are the sidewalks.  Dappled shadows hang over the
walkway, thrown by the crossed branches of trees thick with Spanish moss. 
Many of the trees are cypress, and older than New Orleans.  Elegant stoops
on flat-faced buildings flank the sidewalks.  Pots of ferns and wisps of
flowering greenery dangle from iron balconies overhead.  A few estates are
nuzzled safely into locked gates on Spanish courtyards, with house numbers
on the walls outside to imply a state of residence.  The antique streetlamps
characteristic of the older portions of New Orleans are present here.

#wToulouse Street#n~
The lamps of Toulouse are well-maintained and their light cool and pale
yellow.  Boutiques and other shops mingle with the closed Spanish courtyards
of private residences.  Buildings painted pastel colors house multiple
residents in apartment complexes.  Iron balconies dangle potted plants over
the street.  The sidewalks lining Toulouse are old and in places cracked. 
Rebellious plants grow through the spaces in the pavement, struggling to
reclaim the marsh from New Orleans.  Grills in the gutters loose clouds of
steam into the nighttime air.  A narrow alley slithers away to the west,
leading directly from Toulouse to Canal Street.  An older house lodged
between a couple buildings sits to the east, with a muscle car parked in the
driveway and a tidy rows of flowers running up the sides of the path to the
front door.  Hidden in the flowers is a tiny garden gnome with a red pointed
hat.

homes clutter Dauphine's streetsides.  Wood shutters painted in hues that
match the color of each house are fitted to the tall windows, and recessed
balconies with elegant, sharply slanted roofs look over the street.  As far
as neighborhoods in the French Quarter go, this one is unusually uniform and
quite clean.  Cafes and boutiques are prevalent, busy at all hours of day or
night.  They are tucked neatly into old shotgun style homes that were
converted to commercial buildings a few decades ago.  The streetlights,
though designed to look older than they are, are modern and new, with fresh
energy-saving bulbs that put off pale bluish light.

#cRobespierre's (Avg. NPCs: 12)#n~
The lights are low to set the mood for an enjoyable seafood meal.  The
room is broken up into two areas, the bar in the front of the restaurant and
the dining room in the back.  Two long bank of windows run along two sides
of the building one over looking the street the other over looking the
River.  A combination of large family booths upholstered in emerald green
and gold fabric and smaller intimate ones line the walls where the windows
are.  In the center of the room are gold tablecloth covered square tables
that can be pulled together to make larger tables when the need arises.  The
dcor is understated yet elegant in its design.  Over the table hangs from a
chair a hurricane lamp giving enough light to read the menu.  The floors are
hardwood polished and poly-coated.  The walls and ceiling is paneled a deep
reddish teak tongue and groove adding to the ship like feel.  Large carved
pilasters separate the dining from the bar area, where brass fixtures accent
the dark wood bar.  Next to the front door is a dais where the hostess has
her book for reservations.

A loveseat with rather outdated upholstery, a pair of identical cots both
piled with blankets, and a large circular rug that covers the cold floor and
provides a little bit of insulation for the room is the only furniture
present in this place of residence.  The otherwise barren wooden walls have
a single photograph tacked on, directly to the side of one of the cots.  A
tiny, well-used kitchenette is stocked with only the basic items of
survival, though oddly enough there appears to be a bag of jelly beans in a
jar upon the tiny, out of date fridgerator.

`pA Cramped Room`n~
This cramped room is quite dim.  The walls are carefully papered in a
soft amber, broken up by heavy, ochre curtains on a solitary window.  The
floor is plain wood, painted a warm brown evocative of cocoa and accented
with a springtime green rug that fits the small room nicely.  Shoved against
one wall is an old, faded brown pull out sofa.  Two pillows are thrown
haphasardly on either side, they look as though they belong on a bed and not
in a livingroom.  The sofa is edged by an old wooden chair and a small end
table.  The coffee table carefully placed in the middle of the room is bare,
save a small, withered cactus.  An antiquated television set sits on a
rickety table opposite the sofa, one of its dials is missing and the power
button is now just a hole.  Opposite the window is a small kitchenette
consisting of an aquamarine stove, refridgerator, and single counter.  Close
to the stove is a heavy curtain which hides a bathroom large enough for only
a toilet, small sink and a shower head.  Upon further inspection it becomes
clear that the entire bathroom is a stand up shower.  The entire apartment
is utilitarian, void of clutter, dirt or dust.  Simply, it is quite
immaculate and despite its size and garish appliances is oddly comfortable
and homey.

This is a blatantly rickety, unsafe structure, managing to stay afloat
despite heavy rotting and significant damage by luck alone.  The interior
bears remnants of former glory in the peeling royal purple paint that coats
the wooden walls, the water-damaged old furnishings in Parisian style and
the once luxurious - now acrid smelling, molding - wall to wall carpeting in
the cabin.  Every step causes the boat to dangerously lurch, and anything of
worth has either been destroyed by age and wear, or was stolen long ago.

A tiny cabin loft above the bar on the docks. The floors are of planked
wood, and one can see through the spaces between each plank the basics
of what is going on below. A single, two by five window shows a broad
view of the muddy currents of the Mississipi. Several tables with white
tablecloths that look as though they've been stained at some point but
were vigorously cleaned are arranged over the span of the room. A bench
seat beneath the window offers an additional place to sit.

The buildings on Burgundy Street are all made from chipped salmon colored
brick, from the tallest apartment complexes to the little shotgun homes that
pop up almost on top of the sidewalk.  The long shadows of cypress trees and
brightly painted terraces fall across the narrow road.  This is a solely
residential area, zoned for nothing else.  A dizzying microcosm with widely
ranging incomes, Burgundy Street boasts everything from vacation bungalows
to Section 8 housing.  An unusual number of granite gargoyles have found a
home here, looming strategically from rooftops with twisted faces in
malicious grimaces.  The jasmine and wild vines of roses that grow naturally
in Louisiana marshes have found their way through the courtyards and cracks
of sidewalks to climb up drain pipes and tangle through terraces.  Pale
yellow pools of street light brighten the sidewalk every fifteen yards.

`gA large pond`n~
A never-ceasing gentle array of shallow ripples move across the surface
of this surprisingly clear pond by the persuasion of an undetectable breeze.
Ancient, drooping trees with massive branches that seem to stretch beyond
limit to enclose the water in a protective embrace grow in densely scattered
patches, and a pebbled shore lines the gently lapping edge of the water
itself.  Spanish moss hangs from the branches, appearing like dark, delicate
lace that has been draped by a meticulous hand through the curling leaves of
the wood.  A long stretch of wood and thick rope extends across a third of
the length of the pond, creaking in a gentle song with the movement of the
waters clear, reflective waters of greenish-black.  Hanging from a
particularly huge tree with a branch that stretches specifically across the
middle of the pond is a length of rope with a few knots in it.  A large,
flat rock extends over a foot or so of the water, nestled into the marshy,
pebble-strewn ground at the very edge.  There is a barely noticeable pile of
tiny, similarly flat rocks piled atop it.  In one of the larger trees at the
supposed entrance of the grove is a carving that has been cut into the
trunk.

`GClearing in the foliage`n~
The foliage and heavy trees give away here to allow for a large clearing. 
Cypruss draped with spanish moss dot the landscape, but the dense, savage 
foliage present in nearly every other direction seems to have surrendered 
to make way for this region of relative peace. Thick fog hangs above the 
ground and a heavy, humid scent is present in the air. To the west at the 
near edge of the clearing stands a relatively small sized, two-story 
structure, enclosed on all sides by a white picket fence that has been 
heavily overridden by wild rose vines riddled with thorns.

`eLiving Area`n~
A huge expanse spacious enough to be half a ballroom spans past the huge, 
thick-mahogany double-doors that mark the entrance of the condo. Wall to 
wall carpeting of a thick cream color that causes any footfalls to sink in at 
least an inch lines the whole of the floor, all the way up to the door that 
leads west, and the pair of single-paned french doors that open to a garden 
visible in the murky darkness south. A collection of dark mahogany furniture 
is arranged throughout the main of the living space; a pair of fat, dark 
vermillion sofas are arranged facing one another, perhaps seven feet between 
them, and a pair of rather comfortable looking cream-white cushioned chairs 
stand opposite each other, one on either end of the couches, closing off the 
sitting area. Mounted above the couch that is flush against the wall is a 
battle-ready katana upon a mahogany base. Against the wall beneath a series 
of `wportraits`n hung in a diagonal is a Feurich  full-backed spruced Klaviere 
Piano upon an upraised, tiled platform. Sat at a forty-five degree angle from 
the `wpiano`n is a medieval fainting chair of rich, green velvet, and on the 
ceiling directly above is a perfectly round stained glass `wwindow`n. The rest of 
the wallspace is completely occupied by dark oak bookshelves that span from 
floor to vaulted ceiling, packed completely with haphazard texts of every 
shape, color and genre. A spiraling staircase with smoothly polished steps of 
mahogany leads to the second floor.

window~
Little shards of deeply tinted glass that catch the light and glint like
tiny gems of brilliant color have been crafted together to form a mosaic
of flawlessly etched symbols; a pair of slashed X's sit on opposite ends
of a deep green crown, one red and one blue, all three of which are at
opposite ends of a broken mirror in an almost crystal clear white, and 
another crown, this one in hues of gold. The window itself is perfectly
round, with silver lead etchings and a pewter rim.
`n
Around the edges of the window hang a small series of mobiles, from which
dangle a selection of regal looking pewter symbols upon clear nylon cords;
A crown much like the one featured in the window, a rose on a short, 
curved stem, and a sceptre are the displayed symbols.

There is a group  portrait, perhaps the  largest one featured, contained 
in a rich  cherry wood  frame,  depicting four men, and one  girl. `G(`glook

'Ronan Staley' in the corner. `G(`glook portrait2`G)

piano~
This tall concert klaveiere piano is made out of dark mahogany and 
cherrywood, with inlays of light walnut. It's colour is a polished dark 
maroon, and it sheens as if well cared for. Good tuning has kept this 
old treasure in mint condition, "Feurich" has been layed in with golden 
text on the head of the piano.
~
E
tree~
Perched majestically within a deeply crimson stand of curling iron with 
sharp prongs that jut out from the the initial decorative holder and stick
into a narrow, sap scented trunk, is a massive `oScotch`g Pine`n tree -- the 
conifer known as the cosmopolitan tree of Europe. Sharp blue-green foliage
with needles about two or three inches in length have been sheared to an
appealing density, and `wsp`ea`wrkl`ei`wng wh`ei`wte`r C`gh`rr`gi`rs`gt`rm`ga`rs`n lights dangle throughout
the branches, draping around it's conical shape several times over to 
provide a dense illusion of an inner, sparkling light. Both handmade 
ornaments in crudely crafted designs and exquisitely painted or carved
decorations have been hung upon the needles from thin wire hooks, lining 
the whole reach of the massive conifer save for the very crown, which is
marked by a tiny angel with hair of spun `og`yo`old`n and a penny-sized halo that
casts a pale hallowed glow over the beautiful features of the heavenly
host. 
~
E
boxes~
Arranged in a haphazardly pleasant way around the whole base of the
decorative and well-lighted tree are several boxes of various sizes, all 
wrapped in reflective, patterned or gauzy tissue-like paper. Curling 
ribbons in all colors have been tied around the boxes, and tags upon 
each wrapped cube or rectangle address the bestowed in small, scrawling 
letters to either '`eVilkian`n,' '`eWyl`n,' '`eAuric`n,' '`eXander`n,' '`eDarren`n,' '`eMarie`n,'
'`eEsteban`n,' '`eSully`n,' or some other random recipient. The strong scent of 
pine and sap is a heavy, overwhelming odor around the boxes, wafting 
down from the boughs of the tree above to fill the senses of the onlooker. 
Off to the side, set reverenly away from any adjoining boxes, is a very 
small, very heavy container, wrapped up in `gfine green tissue paper `nand 
bearing a tag with the name, '`eEdge`n' upon it.
~
E
menorah~
Seven perfectly connical`w white waxen candles`n sit in a verical pyramid
shape, held aloft by a simple affair of a menorah: Seven thin `eiron arms`n
stretch out to hold the lit pillars of wax, extending from a delicate,
though sturdy tower of iron balanced by a triple pronged stand. Seven
small `rf`Rl`ya`Rm`res`n flicker above the candles, clinging to the wicks with 
ethereal little halos of `wlight`n. 
~
E
portrait1~
On the wall opposite the  window is a large portrait of a petite, rather 
childlike girl  with  dark, curling hair and almost eerily glowing green 
eyes  who  sits  upon a cherrywood  chair. Behind her stands a series of
men; A  tall  man with soft,  sensuous  lips and a head of short, barely
curling brown hair that flawlessly  offsets his  pale  blue eyes has one
hand  placed  upon the girl's  shoulder, and at his  side  stands a just
slightly  taller  man with a muscular stature, black hair and blue eyes,
who is leaning against the girl's other  shoulder.  Directly  behind her
is  a towering figure  with  dark, onyx skin, who  remains rather in the
shadows  of  the  portrait, as though  he  preferred it that way. At the 
right of the painting  is a man  in a suit with spanish features, and to 
the left is a rather young looking man with spiked black hair and modern 
clothing, both with glowing green eyes that match the girl.
~
E
portrait2~
A stunning  sunset  looms  over  the  distant  lilac  horizon, kissing a 
reflection across  the  still,  calm  sea of  indigo  blue. The  sky  is 
shocked  into  layers of  colour  from the  small  crimson sphere to the 
creamy orange glow  swallowing it, to the  purples and  pinks  the light 
beams split  the air into  like  layers  of the most magnificent wedding 
cake made solely out of pastel light. The  water laps lazily against the 
dark sand and  rocks on the beach, tranquility  being a  word perfect to 
describe it. Upon one of the larger, more dominant  rocks sits  the tiny 
figure of a young girl with pale  ivory skin  and  shockingly expressive 
irridescent  green  eyes  which  regard the  sunset  casting  her  as  a 
silhouette with  a certain  melancholic  awe, or  want. Her  hair  hangs 
around  her  face in  slight curling  waves  which  match  the  flowing, 
delicate black dress  which is  fluttering about her petite form, frozen 
in painted eternity.

#wIntersection of Burgundy and Dauphine Street#n~
Parked cars line the street on both sides, creating an even more cramped
space for passage down the notoriously narrow road.  Tucked in behind the
rows of parked cars are the sidewalks.  Dappled shadows hang over the
walkway, thrown by the crossed branches of trees thick with Spanish moss. 
Many of the trees are cypress, and older than New Orleans.  Elegant stoops
on flat-faced buildings flank the sidewalks.  Pots of ferns and wisps of
flowering greenery dangle from iron balconies overhead.  A few estates are
nuzzled safely into locked gates on Spanish courtyards, with house numbers
on the walls outside to imply a state of residence.  The antique streetlamps
characteristic of the older portions of New Orleans are present here.

`eA Large Study`n~
A pair of dark mahogany doors carved and etched with intricate designs along
the edges resembling curling ivy, with matching gold-hued handles resembling
roses in bloom open to reveal a large, cozy study. Bookshelves absolutely
brimming with reading material line the northern and southerrn walls, filled
from edge to edge with novels, encyclopedias, reference texts, editions of
Shakespeare, Machiavelli, and several thousand editions of literature that 
are leatherbound, without titles, and appear to be the most ancient of all
the shelved tomes. Opposite the door flush to the wall is a trio of large,
antique `wdesks`n that have seen quite a bit of wear and tear, though they have
been well taken care of. A large, lavish fireplace is the sole object upon
the eastern wall, and before it is placed a tall, leather-backed chair with
an iron legged table set next to it. Atop the table is a box of Cuban cigars,
accompanied by a gold-hued ash tray. A pair of paneless, lengthy vertical
windows flank the fireplace, and deep green drapes embroidered with silver
and gold thread designed to be vines in bloom hang from matching gold rods
above each. Electrical lights are built into the ceiling, and an ancient 
chandelier hangs from direct middle, casting dappled shadows over the room.

desk1~
The owner of this desk keeps it fairly immaculate, a few leather-bound tomes 
sitting in one corner, held up by a black-handled dagger that has been 
implanted into the wood of the desk itself. One book is laying open, the 
literary characters on the page in some undecipherable language, as noted by 
a slip of paper pinned to the book saying, "Use for next bonfire". The surface 
is dusted and oiled regularily, to keep it's sheen, although there are sublte 
cuts and scrapes in it's empecible countenance. It appears as though just 
lately, the owner of this desk has decided it's time to polish up all available 
pointy objects, as there are various daggers litering the normally clear top of 
the desk, as well as used rags and several bottles of polish. In the far corner, 
ontop of the in-sight leather-bound books is a black and white picture of a 
young man with fair hair cropped short, and good looks to boot, and dressed in 
standard military garb. In the corner of the picture is the following, '12/24/41'.

Here lies a long, beaten up `owalnut`n brown desk lies here, complete with matching 
leather-backed chair that's usually covered in a `eblack`n trenchcoat. `eSi`wlv`eer`n fringe 
runs along the sides and edges, and on the right half of the desk lies a `eblack`w-`ecased`n 
computer with matching keyboard and `rlaser`e-`roptic `wmouse`n, while on the left lies a 
haphazard pile of sharpened `ep`yencil`rs`n, a sharpener for said pencils, `wp`ba`wp`be`wr`n, and 
books. Drawers with plain, antique handles of matching `esi`wl`ever`n adorn the front of 
the desk, each with a `el`wo`eck`n on them, and no key to be seen. The computer's screen 
saver, which is generally always on, flashes `eN`bever `eF`borget`e.`n However, any attempt to 
revitalize this will only lead one to a screen asking for a password. A small, 
beaten up piece of metal hangs on a chain attached around the edge of the monitor, 
engraved with an `e'`wE`e'`n and nearly `gr`ou`gs`ot`ge`od`n beyond all recognition unless you know what
you're looking for.

desk3~
Everything from documents of some importance to gum-wrappers, dried bits
of chrysanthemums and randomly discarded pairs of sunglasses are piled atop

judging by the arrangement of notebooks, files and assortment of different
writing utensils present, whomever the owner is manages despite the clutter.
A picture of a blonde man labelled as "Sully" is framed in pewter and sits
upon the top, along with a crystal vase filled with freshly cut `rr`Re`rd`n

`gA Large, Wild Garden`n~
A pair of glass, mahogany framed french doors open to reveal a large,
barely tamed garden.  A high wall obstructs view of anything but the garden
itself, seeming consistantly on the brink of being overrun by a torrent of
wild, thorny rose vines and thick tendrils of spanish moss.  At the very
center of the garden stands a dark, almost eerily reflective pool, flanked
on all sides by soft grass to permit sitting, and a scattered assortment of
deeply colored Chinese poppies, which in places are so thick that the ground
cannot be seen through their paper thin, delicate blossoms.  Orchids of dark
violet and satin black grow from the more moist places around the pool, and
dotted haphazardly among the rest of the greenery is yet another wash of
brilliantly red poppies.  A pair of Japanese apple trees grow at opposite
ends of the garden, their massive branches looming over the pool as though
it's twisted arms were guardians over something sacred.  In painted stone
pots near the door have been planted with care a few stalks of white
chrysanthemums.  Set even further apart from the rest of the foliage and
plantlife is a broad, porcelin pot filled with crimson stained earth that
seems to hold only a tiny, scant rosebush with black blooms.  White
Christmas lights are strung from the overhang of the house, and an obviously
homemade rainbow plastic windchime hangs amidst the lights.

`wCommunal Quarters`n~
The ceiling here is low and comforting, being only perhaps seven and a
half feet from the thickly red carpeted floor.  Light fixtures that cast
calming, yellow light over the objects and persons present are fixed to the
walls in frosted, crescent-moon shaped sconces.  Personal effects belonging
to the assumed occupants of the house can be seen mounted upon the walls or
arranged methodically around the space on tables or in display cases. 
Toward the middle of the quarters is set a huge, circular table surrounded
by plush leather chairs, each with a pillow bearing a name stitched upon it
in crimson thread.  Upon the table itself is a rosewood box.  A pair of
chairs off to one side of the room sit on opposite sides of a stout mahogany
table, holding only an exquisitely carved chess set and matching board.  The
walls are dotted here and there with a few amateur paintings of sunrises,
and a select few `wnewspaper`n articles, one of which has been framed. 
Mounted above the western door is a sleek glass case, and inside is a
mounted`w axe`n.  A huge, locked weapons cabinet is off to the side of the
western door.  There is a simple staircase leading up into the ceiling, to a
third floor, and doors line each side of the room, leading into private

set~
The pieces of this chess set have been carved from ivory and black
marble, both of which have a slight yellowish tinge to them and an
unusually heavy feel. Exquisitely detailed, carved faces, all of 
which are proud and defiant, stare back at the observer. The queens
of both the black and white are carved into identical childlike
visages, the face of Marie, should someone be familiar enough to
recognize her. The King of the white set is that of Cervantes, and
the King of the Black, Patrick. The rooks of both are realistic
reproductions of the visage of Auric, much like the Bishops are
Xander, and the Knights Dantae. The pawns, oddly, have been left
unadorned; faceless figures stacked protectively before the players 
of each side.

`w"Horrible Shadow Covers New Orleans!"
`w                           July 10, 2005
`n
`eA blackout struck the French Quarter late last night with terrible 
effects. People trapped in the dark said that although it only lasted 
a few minutes there was a terror that it brought to the whole district 
of the city. A witness was quoted to have said, "It was like I couldn't 
breathe, I started soffucating, and it was cold I was shivering. It was 
like being buried alive almost."
`e
Numerous residents of the area reported the same symptoms, and emergency 
services logged over four-hundred calls to 911 reporting a "dark cloud" 
over the French Quarter. The LSU Hospital's emergency room was packed 
beyond capacity as hundreds of people came in with elderly relatives in 
cardiac arrest and children on the brink of death from asthma attacks and 
bronchial disorders.
`e
Immediately after the blackout, riots started across Bourbon Street in 
fear and anger at local authorities that failed to protect them. The 
death total for the night was over fifty dead, with another seventy in 
intensive care.`n

#wIntersection of Burgundy Street and Esplande Avenue#n~
Poorly maintained streets make vehicular travel down Esplande beneficial
for local automotive shops.  There are numerous pot holes - holes often
disguised by puddles of rain and mud.  After sunset no police patrol this
stretch of road.  The lack of law enforcement is particularly evident in the

`eA Large, Cozy Bedroom & Sitting Room`n~
Sunken into the floor against the far wall of this rather large bedroom is 
what would appear to be the frame of a legless, gigantic mahogangy sleigh 
bed. Instead of mattresses, scores of large, over-stuffed pillows with 
black and red satin covers have been piled into the frame, filling it to the 
brim. A few soft, black down comforters are arranged above wine colored 
sheets that curl over topmost blanket, all of said items haphazardly cast 
onto the horde of pillows. The walls and ceiling are covered in billowing
black silk and have been laced with an intricate lighting system composed of
tiny white sconces that barely peek out from within the silk, causing the 
causing the room to appear almost enclosed in a clear night sky. Descending
a pair of short steps leads one into a sitting area, completely surrounded
by dark bookshelves that are absolutely packed with titleless literature. 
Within the shelves has been placed a black velvet medieval fainting chair,
and a large leather chair that looks somewhat more masculine than it's 
counterpart. A simple, dark`w armoire`n has been placed against the far wall, 
and upon it sits a gently glowing`w aquarium`n, filled with six multi-colored 
fish. There is an open doorway on the western wall that leads into a black 
tiled `wbathroom`n containing only a sink and a deep tub.

E
bathroom~
This bathroom is tiled from top to bottom in pattered crimson and black
glass. There is no mirror to be found anywhere, not even above the 
deep, pewter-fauceted sink. A sunken tub that reminds one more of a 
jacuzzi than a typical bath takes up around sixty percent of the
bathroom space, with a bench to sit upon that would allow the occupant
a sort of waterfall-ridden effect, and a widened area further down in
a large oval shape. Two pewter knobs, one with a label for hot and 
the other cold, are small and angular shaped, and the faucet itself is
in the form of a small girl, pouring water from a bucket into the tub.
There are a few cannisters of incense and small black waxed candles 
around the tub, in addition to a box of long matches. Three matching
towels are upon a rack on one wall, one of which looks rather wrinkled
and gross.

#wEsplande Avenue#n~
Poorly maintained streets make vehicular travel down Esplande beneficial
for local automotive shops.  There are numerous pot holes - holes often
disguised by puddles of rain and mud.  After sunset no police patrol this
stretch of road.  The lack of law enforcement is particularly evident in the
brazen locations of graffiti; elsewhere an "artist" might want to find a
side or back wall.  Here they paint over the faces of buildings - those
directed at traffic.  Everything from "Fuck America!"  to less dignified
messages are sprayed onto the walls, mingled with makeshift murals of more

`pA Large, Macabre Bedroom`n~
Upon entering this room it would seem as though one had just walked
through the door separating the waking world from that of the dream realm. 
There is literally a hazy purple mist that curls about the floor, roughly
mid-shin height, obscuring the floor entirely.  Each of the walls are
painted a deep satin black, not sleek, so they look as though there is
nothing but the dark emptiness of the Pit itself all around.  In the very
center of the swirling fog is a large four-poster bed, covered in purple
silk sheets and pillows of similar make.  The canopy of it and the curtains
that hang in between each poster are identical to the silk sheets on the
bed, although the curtains are also decorated with strings and designs of
black gem stones.  Scattered intermittently about the room, their bottoms
concealed by the violet fog, are Greek-esque pedestals, some cracked and
some not.  The fog of course, is produced by small air ducts in the corners
of the room that constantly pour in the low hanging mist, it's strange
colouring being caused by many purple lights that have been placed into the
bottoms of the pedestals.  Hanging from the roof are three things, one of
which is a crystal chandelier that hangs from the ceiling about a foot away
from the foot of the bed, with purple light bulbs screwed into it.  The
other two things are two pairs of shackles, their occupants both gagged and
nude, but not blindfolded.

#wUrsulines Street#n~
Parked cars line the street on both sides, creating an even more cramped
space for passage down the notoriously narrow road.  Tucked in behind the
rows of parked cars are the sidewalks.  Dappled shadows hang over the
walkway, thrown by the crossed branches of trees thick with Spanish moss. 
Many of the trees are cypress, and older than New Orleans.  Elegant stoops
on flat-faced buildings flank the sidewalks.  Pots of ferns and wisps of
flowering greenery dangle from iron balconies overhead.  A few estates are
nuzzled safely into locked gates on Spanish courtyards, with house numbers
on the walls outside to imply a state of residence.  The antique streetlamps
characteristic of the older portions of New Orleans are present here.

elegant desk and hidden closet round out the necessities.  There is a small
vanity with a basin for minor grooming to be done, and a small framed
announcement next to it on the wall gives directions down the hallway to the
bath and facilities.  Sheer panels let in plenty of light during day and
heavier elegant cerulean with gold finger draperies can be pulled at night for
privacy.  The coverlet on the bed and the matching decorative pillows also
are dark-blue with gold trimmings.  An antique armoire with double doors
opens to reveal television, stereo and video equipment.  A bell pull at the
door with posted instructions indicates that if room service is requested,
simply tug on the pull anytime before midnight.

#wToulouse Street#n~
The lamps of Toulouse are well-maintained and their light cool and pale
yellow.  Boutiques and other shops mingle with the closed Spanish courtyards
of private residences.  Buildings painted pastel colors house multiple
residents in apartment complexes.  Iron balconies dangle potted plants over
the street.  The sidewalks lining Toulouse are old and in places cracked. 
Rebellious plants grow through the spaces in the pavement, struggling to
reclaim the marsh from New Orleans.  Grills in the gutters loose clouds of
steam into the nighttime air.  The face of O'Flaherty's Irish Pub is smooth
gray stucco and old doors painted bright clover green, opening to the east.

Earth toned brickwork towers over Canal Street; buildings specifically
designed for granduer in an age now gone.  Modern skyscrapers tower higher
than their older, more dignified companions.  New restaurants, apartment
complexes and fresh corporate offices are built behind facades intended to
make them look older, but they still stick out like sore thumbs; anything
new is obvious in the French Quarter and Canal Street is no exception.  Even
with its five lane road and heavy traffic it's in New Orleans, and New
Orleans is antiqued je ne se quais.  Roaming youths, staggering street
ladies, barely concealed homeless and overflowing alleys reveal the culture
that exists in the moonlight, even if the polish on modern Canal Street
would prefer to ignore it.

`eA Large Suite`n~
With every step in this room, the distinguishable sound of crushed glass
resonates in the silent darkness.  Shards of broken glass, found in all
sizes, cover the floor, seeming to originate from a single corner, where an
aged wooden crate filled with broken mirrors and broken mirror frames sits. 
A simple bed rests in the opposite corner, not a bell nor whistle to be
found on it.  The nightstand that sits near the bed holds what appears to be
a giant mass of melted wax--at least several dozen candles worth--a
half-used candle as the zenith of the mountain, the only light source in the
room.  A closet rests in a wall full of the owners stylish wardrobe,
including clothes that look like they could be from anywhere between now and
over a century ago.

`eA Large Personal Suite`n~
The room stumbled upon is the room of a man who enjoys his appearance,
as much is certain.  A large wardrobe stands in a corner, mirrors covering
the insides of the doors, with several small spots directed at it, besides
the wardrobe is a cherrywood desk, large and imposing.  Upon it as at all
times a large quantity of paper, leaflets promoting jazzclubs, letters and
the likes.  A kingsize bed covered with red satin sheets rest in another
corner, it's sturdy wooden frame of dark wood, indeed the entire room goes
in dark tones, from the dark wooden panels to the red leather recliner in a
corner.  Next to the recliner is a large bookshelf, tomes gathered in the
shelf are mostly classics, and a few well thumbed copies of Shakespears
collected works shine with their presence.  A gramophone rests in the shelf,
the rest of the shelf being taken up by LP's.  The music taste of the man
seems to go between Jazz and classical music.  A hand drawn and framed
picture resting on the corner of the desk draws the eye, it's fine and
meticolous drawing seeming to resemble a large and imposing man, far more
imposing and noble than a man could possibly be with spiked obsidian hair
and a black coat, skulls covering the shoulders of the man.

Street bears no signifcant nightlife, no parties, no tourists.  What people
there are stick in clusters, huddling close around barrels filled with
smoldering debris, or moving cautiously past the mouths of shadowed alleys
together.  It reeks of vomit, urine, and worse.  The street got its name
from the rampart that was built on the north side in the city's early years
to fortify the early French colonial settlement.  North Rampart features
classic lightposts reminiscent of the past, though the bulbs are burned or
busted and the city lacks the means or desire to fix them.  A few years back
the street underwent a temporary Renaissance, with citizens determined to
change the face - and fate - of the once thriving strip.  They were met with
the resistence of the residents and squatters, who chased any chace of
reform back into the rest of the city.  Mere remnants of their efforts
remain.

to resemble marble, and a large chandelier hangs quietly overhead.  Hanging
lights illuminate this room with a gentle glow, giving it a warm feeling
quite unlike the cold foyer below.  Hallways lead east and west from the
landing, the doors along their length leading to the numerous guest
bedrooms.  A large set of double doors lead into bedrooms at several points,
the doors themselves embossed with the same ornate "CC" symbol that is
mirrored throughout the mansion.

`eA Large Ground-Floor Bedroom`n~
The first thing that would strike a person entering this room would be
the large, single-pane window facing west which very nearly takes up the
entirety of that wall, looking out over the wild beauty that is the garden
from a near-perfect angle of appreciation.  A black, light-blocking blind is
built into the frame of the window itself, and it is obvious that the whole
pane of glass can be covered completely with it.  The room itself is sunk
down several feet from the doorway, needing a set of three steps to allow
access into the body of the area.  Such a design however, allows the window
stated to exist in much larger proportions than normal.  The ambience of the
space is light and purposefully sparse; the floor a type of Japanese-wicker
with a thick circular beige rug in the center of the room housing a
squashy-looking beanbag large enough to swallow a full-grown man with
assorted poetry and literature books laying around it.  To add to the
airiness of the room, the walls are pure white save for each corner which
houses a faux-wooden strut, and the ceilings match in paleness and emptiness
save for the three lines of chrome-edged spotlights.  The bed is tucked into
an alcove to the north, consisting of a low-set and clean-looking pale beach
frame and white/pastel combination sheets and pillows.  A black electric
guitar is stood at the foot of the bed near a decent-sized amplifier like
some kind of monument, likewise does the dainty CD-player which is
partially-hidden in a small storage closet built into the wall - obviously
housing folded clothes and shoes as well as the music player.  A
barely-visible door gives access to a pristine white-tiled bathroom
containing a deep oval tub and large sink.

#pAn apartment over the Crone mansion#n~
First entering the room, a difference can be seen within the room as it
looks to have a mood of a small apartment.  The split of the room can be
seen with the back half of the room is a step lower than the flooring near
the door.  The floor is carpeted with in a soft mocha color.  A two lounge
chairs rests off to the right with a small glass-top coffee table in between
them.  To the left of the door, a standing Italian-designed wooden armoire
likes against the wall filled with what things that is possessed by the
owner.  After stepping onto the lower level of the room, an elegant wooden,
four-posted canopy bed lies on the left side of the room.  The bed is
covered with a luxury, faux dark puma fur blanket as the headboard is
decorated with different shapes and sizes of pillows covered in #rdark red#n
and #eblack cloth#n.  A #eblack sheer fabric#n is draped over the top of the
canopy of the bed, falling down along the sides of the bed where they are
tied off nicely.  A Victorian style window rests on the back wall of the
mansion as it is draped with several layers of dark-colored heavy curtains.

`wChartres Libraries`n~
Curved shelves composed of arched, sleek matte steel beams line the walls
of this massive, perfectly oval room completely, save for the opening that
gives way to an open, broad Gothic arch in black marble to the south.  Tomes
beyond count fill the shelves from top to bottom, leaving no space open for
storage of anything else upon the beams.  The floors are composed of wood in
the deepest cherry red, sanded perfectly smooth and fitted together with
narrow, interlocking square panels.  Squat four-legged chairs with plush
scarlet or black cushions are placed here and there throughout the ballroom
sized library, with small curling iron-tables topped in surfaces no larger
than a dinner plate.  Modern styled sconces in thin glass descend several
dozen feet from the vaulted ceilings, casting a warm glow throughout the
library suitable for reading in all hours in the night.  Iron ladders
attached in places to the shelves can be slid throughout the room, so that
the upper shelves that lie at twenty five or more feet from the ground may
be accessed.

`cAve Maria altar window`n~
A broad, circular window of stained glass occupies an entire two 'walls'
of the interior belfry, far larger on the interior than it had appeared from
the roof of the Cathedral.  The huge iron bells themselves lie nestled into
ornate arches, encircling the uppermost edge of the tower.  Below the
stained glass window is a ledge of solid, smooth carved stone, and a long,
narrow cushion that stretches from one side to the other.  A rosary is cast
upon a nail that has been hammered into the lowermost frame of the window,
the beads somewhat molded, but still a beautiful relic from an age long
past, carved of damask crimson wood with a tarnished ivory crucifix
suspended from the bottom.  Brilliant flecks are cast across the ground,
speckling anything and anyone who comes here with rich, deep color; the
faces of the Saints depicted in the window, the crucifixion, the weeping
Virgin Mary, grape vines and bread, the sea and the arc, doves in flight
with laurels - all reflect in a myriad of immense pigment, rosettes across
the stone below.  The window stretches high up, reaching a height
approximately akin a second story building, just as wide as it is tall.  A
few flat stone steps lead back down to the roof, and no light but that which
filters through the stained glass manages to penetrate this place.

#wEsplande Avenue#n~
Poorly maintained streets make vehicular travel down Esplande beneficial
for local automotive shops.  There are numerous pot holes - holes often
disguised by puddles of rain and mud.  After sunset no police patrol this
stretch of road.  The lack of law enforcement is particularly evident in the
brazen locations of graffiti; elsewhere an "artist" might want to find a
side or back wall.  Here they paint over the faces of buildings - those
directed at traffic.  Everything from "Fuck America!"  to less dignified
messages are sprayed onto the walls, mingled with makeshift murals of more
significant talent.  Bars line every window and snug Spanish courtyards seal
every home and business away.  The sidewalks are as crooked and spotted with
holes as the road.  A pool of grayish street light brightens the pavement
every fifteen yards.

#wUrsulines Street#n~
Parked cars line the street on both sides, creating an even more cramped
space for passage down the notoriously narrow road.  Tucked in behind the
rows of parked cars are the sidewalks.  Dappled shadows hang over the
walkway, thrown by the crossed branches of trees thick with Spanish moss. 
Many of the trees are cypress, and older than New Orleans.  Elegant stoops
on flat-faced buildings flank the sidewalks.  Pots of ferns and wisps of
flowering greenery dangle from iron balconies overhead.  A few estates are
nuzzled safely into locked gates on Spanish courtyards, with house numbers
on the walls outside to imply a state of residence.  The antique streetlamps
characteristic of the older portions of New Orleans are present here.

`eAn alleyway`n~
This is a small alley between two chipped, brick buildings, padded
thoroughly with discarded bottles, empty cartons of cigarettes and
other random refuse. The direct back of the alley ends with a solid
brick wall, at the bottom of which a double-set of rusty iron doors
leads down into the ground. Looking completely out of place in the
alley is a brand new, quite sturdy padlock upon the pair of doors.

#wToulouse Street#n~
The lamps of Toulouse are well-maintained and their light cool and pale
yellow.  Boutiques and other shops mingle with the closed Spanish courtyards
of private residences.  Buildings painted pastel colors house multiple
residents in apartment complexes.  Iron balconies dangle potted plants over
the street.  The sidewalks lining Toulouse are old and in places cracked. 
Rebellious plants grow through the spaces in the pavement, struggling to
reclaim the marsh from New Orleans.  Grills in the gutters loose clouds of
steam into the nighttime air.  The smokey blue glow of #bClub Dive#n's
double front doors lie to the west down a short alley.

#yG#oalleria #yL#oafayette #yO#outlets#n~
Tropical mini-palms in gleaming ceramic pots and a spread of frosted
glass rimmed by bronze frames to form various shimmering partitions create
an eclectic shopping experience within the cozy expanse of the Galleria. 
Comfortable couches in brown leather placed upon geometric rugs create small
resting spaces for tired feet.  Nearby, a small section has been cordoned
off for a small yet elegant #oGodiva Coffee#n outlet, beautifully polished
teak chairs and tiny marble-topped round tables set out for the shoppe's
customers.  The smell of coffee lingers like a delicate aroma in the air and
a small shelf near to the coffee outlet's sleek wooden counter is packed
with colorful bags of seasonal blends and small chocolate gifts.  The
glittering displays of the boutiques and designer stores that make up the
lower floor of the galleria attempts to draw the buyer into a osmosis of
expenditure, with porcelain mannequins dressed in the latest Parisian haute
couture and pret-a-porter.  Rather than internationally known mass-brand
names, the galleria sports a different kind of class; the rare yet renowned
designers of this century.

#p#pBoardwalk along the Mississippi#n~
The muddy waters of the Mississippi are black by night.  The industrial
boom shaped the skyline and compromised much of the view many decades before
modern nights, but there are still places where one can stop by the rail and
look over the river, unaffected by the urban decay that strains to obscure
it.  Barge horns remind those within hearing distance that the water exists
with long, mournful calls.  The boardwalk is shadowed by the tangle of
factories, cranes and warehouses crowding the shoreline.  Glass panes form
the eastern wall of #oStarbucks Coffee#n, a posh and unexpected caress on
the face of the waterfront.  The cafe doubles as an entrance to the
Riverwalk Mall.  A paved walkway to Decatur Street splits away to the north.

#w+ #BD#bivine #BC#bouture #w+#n~
A sleek, shimmering modernity surmounts in the design of this haute
couture store, a flagship store by the creative design of the interior. 
Carpeted with silvered gray, resembling that of mink fur, the display
cabinets as well as shelves are all crafted in similar glossy fiberglass of
white and pale lapis-lazuli; which are all filled with designer heels or
bags.  Exquisite gowns for the season dominate the shapely clothe mannequins
in the display facing the main galleria square, while selected pret a porter
dresses, suits and shirts hang on silk-wrapped hangers on polished wooden
fixtures along the walls.  White Italian stucco covers the walls, upon which
paintings of contemporary Oriental art are displayed.  The wares here are
small in range, and crafted from Chinese or Indian silks and brocades. 
Everything is unique in design; rarely would a piece to repetitive in two to
three sets.  In the middle is a white divan, upon an ivory sheepskin rug; a
small shoe- mirror facing it.  The changing rooms are placed at the back,
sheltered by drapes of ultramarine damask.  At a corner, a stylish glass
table is placed, with slim-backed cushy chairs.  Fashion magazines,
catalogues, and even a computer on wireless with an accompanying LCD screen,
is lined up to satiate even the most discerning fashionista.

This is an empty lot with a large stone foundation the size of a mansion
that barely extends past the ground. It would appear by all counts that
a home once stood here that has been recently demolished. No grass or
any of the common weedlike plantlife that tends to grow nearly everywhere
has begun to sprout atop what remains of the mansion, making it further
apparant how recent the demolition took place. The lot extends several
dozen yards to the north, where it would seem the backyard was formerly
held.

A long wood bar and modern black menus with easy-to-read print mounted on

smile and ask what concoction they might create for the flow of customers
that move through the cafe each night.  A variety of biscottis, roasted
coffee beans, gourmet candies and branded coffee mugs are displayed for sale
at unreasonable prices.  The smell here is of coffee, chocolate and dairy
foam.  Every few seconds the steamy schhtooooock of milk being steamed
pierces the conversations of customers.  A few small tables and chairs are
spaced gingerly throughout the cafe.

and other stereotypical office items.  Just behind the desk, directly behind
the large black leather chair which slides beneath it are hordes of dark
wood bookshelves filled with books in a myriad of subjects that include law,
occult, electronics and even various selections of fiction.  The soft hum of
the computer running can be heard.  In the wall behind where the door would
naturally swing inward is a sleek touchpad with a subtle blue glow.

are squeezed in between industrial flatboats, shrimping and shipping
vessels.  Boat houses, little sturdier than shacks, fill the open spaces
down the docksides.  Night workers crowd and bustle about vessels and slips,
avoiding eye contact with passers-by or other strangers to the dockside
scene, though they seem plenty social with their coworkers.  Yellow dock

This is a small opening perhaps six feet wide and twenty feet deep,
filled with nothing but the darkness and damp, surrounded on all sides by
brick.  This alleyway seems to gather the majority of moisture from the air,
sucking away the humidity throughout the day as the sun causes it to
evaporate from the street to the north.  The ground has an inch of viscous,
filthy water upon it.  To the south is a dilapadated apartment building with
three stories.

The lights are low to set the mood for an enjoyable seafood meal.  The
room is broken up into two areas, the bar in the front of the restaurant and
the dining room in the back.  Two long bank of windows run along two sides
of the building one over looking the street the other over looking the
River.  A combination of large family booths upholstered in emerald green
and gold fabric and smaller intimate ones line the walls where the windows
are.  In the center of the room are gold tablecloth covered square tables
that can be pulled together to make larger tables when the need arises.  The
dcor is understated yet elegant in its design.  Over the table hangs from a
chair a hurricane lamp giving enough light to read the menu.  The floors are
hardwood polished and poly-coated.  The walls and ceiling is paneled a deep
reddish teak tongue and groove adding to the ship like feel.  Large carved
pilasters separate the dining from the bar area, where brass fixtures accent
the dark wood bar.  Next to the front door is a dais where the hostess has
her book for reservations.

`nThe `BSt`bar`nlight`B E`bxpress`n Pub (`wAvg. NPCs: 10`n)~
Sleek and silvery, the Starlight Express pub consists of one long bar
counter, the top of which is a smooth creamy deep brown, an immense offering
of various liquors, wines and a top class selection of beers and ales from
barrel-pulls in the front, all snuggled between stainless steel worktops
covered with cocktail mixers, fruit juices and the long black running tubes
of soda-splashers.  Big glass cups for delightful mixes of long island teas
or tequila sunrises stand in stacks of fours and fives, gleaming and ready. 
Tall stools topped with leather cushions of matte gray line up against the
counters for the clientale of this pub, mostly youths and university
students.  Apart from the bar counter, tiny metal tables jostle for space on
the tiled ground, chairs of all sorts of shapes and sizes, some cushioned,
some hardbacked, tucked into them.  The walls are filled with contemporary
art and photographs, some donations from the local university's art college.
A large sign behind the cash register indicates that university students
will be getting discounts for alcohol purchases.  Paper stars sprayed with
silver paint and dotted with glow-in-the-dark stickers hang on the ceiling
of the pub, swaying to the cool gusts of air-conditioning sweeping in from
the vents above.  House music take precedence for most evenings, apart from
Saturdays where a small stage is set up and a local band sings for the
night.

the walls, upon closer observation it is the same style lighting that is in
the floor of every modern movie theatre.  The sound from within the rest of
the house is fully muffled, proving both the door and walls are rather
solid.

Loud, dark, and classic goth.  The Dervish is a hole in the wall on
Decatur Street where the goth and similar don't-give-a-fucks meet to heave
themselves around the scarred dance floor.  Bright colored lights pulsing
behind billowing sheets of dark red cloth throwg undulating shadows and
shards of light around the mirrored bar.  The ear-shattering music blends
with the noise of dozens of conversations and the unabashed echoes of sex
moaning out of the infamously disgusting restrooms.  Bartenders in leather
and chains move at a fevered pace to keep up with the crowds, serving up
doses of sarcastic commentary free with any drink order.  The dance floor
extends westward from the bar, and most of the wall on the side facing
Decatur Street is made up of doors that go nowhere when opened.  A carpeted
staircase covered with bits of gum and less savoury bits of refuse leads up
to the crow's nest, where customers can look over the dance floor from aged
settees on the balcony.

vehicle, and a gigantic pile of debris has been left against the furthest
section of fence. A stone foundation lies to the south.

`BClub Dive`b;`B The Pit `b(`BAvg`b.`B NPCs`b:`B 159`b)`n~
A writhing mass of bodies thrashes around those brave enough to enter
Club Dive, the least public yet most crowded metal venue in the Crescent
City.  There is a violent assault of odors in the pit; from the lulling reek
of marijuana and cigarette smokes to the bitter tang of alcohol, sweat,
piss, and vomit.  The music is always live - a deafening roar with messy,
fast-moving drum beats and roared vocals.  Bands are sealed inside a
chainlink cage at the center of the pit, protecting the musicians from
flying bottles and other debris.  Broken glass has accumulated around the
base of the cage, mingling with cigarette butts, burned roaches and similar
paraphernalia.  The walls of the massive warehouse-sized club are padded
heavily with leather that has been hammered into place with steel rivets. 
To lights are hard to find, and provide only a dull blue glow.

#eA narrow, dark alleyway between Canal and Toulouse#n~
A dark an eerie alley trapped between the high walls of two brick
buildings.  A blanket of darkness holds this area in unnatural stillness. 
The sounds of the day's struggle are lost.  Murky shadows, rubbish and the
occasional rat skittering along with a stolen bit from the trash fills the
space.  The alley is not large enough to house a dumpster, so what trash
litters the area is dumped purposefully or blown into the alley.  Rusted
fire escape ladders hang perilously from the side of one of the buildings,
which also boasts its own private entrance; the wall breaks for a set of
cement stairs that lead up into the lobby floor.  A row of locked mail boxes
are mounted by the stairs.  In both directions there are dimly lit openings
leading back onto the streets.

The floor is covered by a thin layer of old maroon carpet.  The creaky
wood beneath provides a noisy announcement when anything, be it person,
animal, or a stiff breeze, passes through here.  Dozens of thick old doors
made of unfinished wood line the walls, which are made from cracked plaster
that used to be white.  At best one out of ten of the light fixtures
actually work.  A metal painters ladder rests against the wall opposite the
staircase.

`BRoof of Club Dive`n~
Access to the rooftop comes in the form of a decrepit ladder on a rusty
fire escape.  The place is about what one would expect.  The majority of the
roof is paved, and the pavement is badly decayed by Louisiana weather. 
Little is actually up here save a large television antennae and a few broken
slates.  Past the ledge there is a decent view of New Orleans.  A pair of
old binoculars are placed on the edge of the rooftop, next to the antennae. 
They point aimlessly at a nearby residence on Toulouse Street.

#gO'Flaherty's Irish Pub#n~
A burly wooden bar lined with black-covered barstools like a row of
soldiers.  An authentic Irish Currach dating back to the time of druids
hangs from the rafters of the ceiling.  Stacks of "To Go" cups sit on each
end of the bar.  Behind the bar is a long mirror that fills from wall to
wall.  Local flyers, advertisements, an assortment of random papers and a
few hastily pinned shamrocks litter the sides of the mirror.  What Americans
would call authentic Celtic drinks and music are hosted by O'Flaherty's; the
owners might be straight out of the Eire, but they know their audience well.

`eA Kitchen`n~
A stainless steel refrigerator, range oven and a butchers block line the 
main of the wallspace here. The tiled floor is spotless and well maintained. 
A table with four chairs sits in the middle of the kitchen, and upon it sits 
a vase that holds four white chrysanthemums, and a set of bone china. The 
counters are smooth, rich black marble. A collection of decanters that hold 
spices and other necessary cooking items rest beside a steel sink. A brass 
fitted, rather ornate espresso maker sits upon a side board, and a bar with 
several variations of alcohol has been installed beside a six-foot consealed
counter-topped deep freezer. A wine rack with a few good vintages of stock 
wine and champagne is tucked beneath a cubby hole. The counters and black 
and have been dotted randomly with tuscan tiles, and the ceiling is Victorian 
tin. Every major appliance has been somehow concealed within the finely
crafted Italian cabinets, and all of the wood in entire kitchen is dark 
cherrywood. A rocking chair stands against one wall with a small table beside 
it, and upon the table lies a few discarded, half-read books.

#pThe Dungeon#e :#p Courtyard#n~
Old flagstones fitted into mossy earth fill the courtyard.  An
ancient-looking drawbridge angles down over a surprisingly deep gorge that
cuts through the center of the courtyard.  Mist dances lightly upon the moat
that fills the gorge.  Figures moving in and out of the shadows are visible
through the murder holes in the side of The Dungeon's entrance tower.  A
doorman in an executioner's hood stands beside iron-banded wood doors,
admitting or turning newcomers away before they have the chance to cross the
bridge, let alone get a good look at him.  For those permitted entrance the
damp air quickens the senses and lends to the air of danger as the creak of
chains protests weight on the bridge.  As the dungeon doors slide open a
deep voice can be heard to say "Enter." from within.

`eA Garden`n~
This is a private, well-kept garden protected by a high wall that seems
to choke out the outside world, leaving the occupant amidst the silent, 
lush greenery. At the center of the garden stands a dark, reflecting pool,
flanked on either side with twin stone white Greek goddesses. Orchids of 
dark violet and black grow from the more moist places around the pool, and
scattered haphazardly among the other greenery are several different hues
of Chinese poppies. Meticulously trimmed hedges line the walls and give a 
feeling of tranquil organization to the place. A stone bench rests alone,
a good distance from the pool. A few small Japanese apple trees grow in 
the spaces between the hedges, and a single massive peach tree looms over
the pool, it's twisted branches acting as guardians over the sacred spot.

`eA Bedroom`n~
A gigantic mahogany sleigh bed lies upon an upraised, tiled platform. A 
few soft, black down comforters are arranged above wine colored satin 
sheets that curl over topmost blanket. Large, over-stuffed pillows with 
black and red satin covers are arranged before the headboard, and almost 
fill the bed to the footboard. A bedside table on the right holds a dark 
marble ash tray that matches the marble tiled floor. A small lamp made of 
pewter with a dark red shade rests atop the table, along with a few silver 
framed pictures of a dark haired girl walking along the boardwalk in the 
rain. A photo of a woman with long light blonde hair sits beside the first
girls' photo. An expensive jaccuzi bathtub is sunken into the tiled floor 
and can be seen peeking out through the door on the left hand side of the 
bed. A free standing multi-headed shower also has been installed there. A 
few turn of the century tuscan carved wardrobes line the east wall. Along 
the west is a rolltop desk with a lamp that has a dark red glass shade. A 
broken telescope made of brass rests against an empty twin fireplace, and
a large fish tank occupies almost the whole of one wall, filled with 
bright, tropical fish.

A long, polished wood bar with spigots and taps in plain view.  Myriad of
bottles and liquors along the back wall, which is fixed with layers of
shelving.  The stone walls are decorated with ropes, restraints and other
sundry instruments of torture.  Wall scones with flickering light and the
thick candles on each small table weave an eerily dim atmosphere.  Thumping
beats vibrate through the surface of the bar.  Those who aren't dancing or
drinking are migrating up and down the stairs to and from the excitement of
the live DJ and cages above.  Servers in bondage gear work behind the bar,
serving up bubbling goblets of Witches Brew and Dragon's Blood.

`eGreat Room`n~
The floor is of this room is tiled completely in mirror-polished black 
deep purple veined marble. Beside the front door rests a small table 
of cast iron; the three metallic rose-designed legs holding atop them 
a smooth, dark wood top. A basket of Bella Candella scented candles 
has been placed atop the table, and a large black leather couch offers 
itself like a sprawling cat before the Tuscan, hand-tiled fireplace. 
The ceiling is vaulted and has black ceramic molding with gold gothic
leaf molding encased its Grigio Venetian plaster. A tasteful Brotelli 
crystal chandelier hangs at a moderate height, bathing the room in soft,
warm light. Two overstuffed black leather chairs with matching ottomans 
rest angled on either side of the sofa, and an end table rests at the 
side of each chair; a marble ashtray atop one of them next to a decanter 
of whiskey with four small tumblers on a simple but elegant silver tray, 
and a bust of a noble looking woman with a basket of dried wild flowers
on the other, sitting next to an arrangement of three dark apples.
Pewter framed prints of the classical masters of Italy dot the walls,
and a tapestry of the Battle of Hastings covers the entire west wall but
for a dark door with a bronze door knob. On the wall across from the 
couch has been installed a concealed entertainment center, hidden 
within an elaborate mahogany fade of a free standing intricately carved 
shelf. The shelves themselves hold a large collection of classical works 
and a selection of other books. A well-stocked mahogany wetbar with a 
small fridge and three matching barstools with leather pads lies upon 
the wall next to the northern door.

neat pile of office tools however in the first drawer complete with paper
clips, staples, tape and writing utensils.  The right bottom drawer is
locked and the rest of the desk looks to be well used.

#pVenus Bar and The Cage#n~
Deeper and deeper into the dungeon are flickering torches and lamps that
give off just enough light to navigate the stone walkways.  Bones and skulls
adorn the walls, and an old bronze plaque tells the tale of feminine victims
held captive and tortured here before finding their eternal resting place as
decor.  A collage of skulls graces the wall behind a short bar covered in
black cloth, with tall barstools and a faceless bartender dressed in an
executioner's mask.  Though the music is still audible from above, things
are quieter and more intimate here in the bowels of the dungeon.  An iron
cage dangles from the rafters, holding a leather-clad man and woman dancing
together.

#eA Small Hallway#n~
This rather small space is angular and narrow, quite nearly triangularly
shaped from the point of the door to the more broad portion where the
hallway continues into darkness.  The walls have been draped in scarlet
hangings, laden with cream hued lace that hangs from the ceiling in even
sways.  At the very center of the room, upon a round, indian-woven rug sits
only a circular table set with a scarlet red cloth, and a single white
candle in a crystal holder at the very center, crested by a small wreath of
woven lilies intertwined with white and crimson ribbon.  Twin crystal fluted
glasses sit upon either end of the table on white place-cloths, and a large
clear olive-glass wine bottle sits within a polished holder, filled oddly
with heated stones to keep it warm as opposed to ice to keep it cold.  Two
chairs are set one either side, and a small, folded letter on thick paper
sits beside one of the flute-glasses, tied into a scroll with a silk white
kerchief embroidered upon one corner.

trim, from the wall paint and crown moulding to the hand towels and soap
dispensers.  This room is well-lit with blazing torches.  The individual
stalls are spacious, providing more than enough room to change clothes.  The
fixtures are made of black porcelain and trimmed in gold.  Opposite the
toilet stalls are a few plump chairs and a coffee table.  A bookshelf with a
few magazines and hardcovers is provided.

The nightclub bustle dissolves as one enters this long hallway.  Sultry
purple velvet covers the stone walls, and sconces seep dim light through the
walkway.  The hall is at least ten degrees cooler than the nightclub. 
Flagstones are laid down the center of the hall, forming a path from the
club to a few thick wooden doors.  Card swipers activate the electronic
locks on the doors.  This self-enforcing security system makes it known
without signs or postings that this is a restricted part of The Dungeon.

above the door pans the small distance between the entrance and the mouth of

lounging bodies around a wall fitted with book-packed recessed shelves,
gorgeous Jean Jouvenet and other naturalist Baroque artists' original
paintings, and tasteful touches of modern convenience.  A touch screen
television mounted to the wall above a cold hearth plays soft classical
music to the images of global cityscapes, and a long wood desk houses
several Apple Macbooks without passwords.  A modest wood door with a simple
lock leads to the conference room.

Long stretches of wood and metal creak in a gentle song with the 
movement of the lakes murky gray waters offering solace to the bobbing 
vessels moored there. Everything from speed boats of new make and 
model to plodding old house boats bob along the stretching piers, each 
held firm by stout rope and thick wood sunk deep into the bed of the 
lake. Gulls and heron pause now and again on the ends of the piers 
amongst a coil of thick rope and a stray life vest, forgotten amongst 
the bustle of the day. Back up along the line of the shore stout white 
clad buildings await those shopping for quick snacks or a chilled 
beverage. A single stout pole bares a bright over head light, casting 
away the shadows from even the darkest corners of the piers.

The Cafe du Monde is bustling with business as the people of Vieux Carre
flock to their favorite coffee house.  The rich aroma of food and coffee
waft up through the open air dining area and fill your senses.  Groups of
open-air tables are set under a protective awning and are ready for
luncheon.  Many people still working on late breakfasts, the customers enjoy
all variations of the java bean, from traditional coffee, espressos, and
lattes to the wonderfully rich and famous Cafe Au Lait.  Clustered groups of
clouds drift slowly across the black sky, occasionally blocking the moon.  A
fluttering breeze can occasionally be felt, rustling a few leaves then
whispering away.

Shaded brothel lamps are scattered through the room; sultry beacons in a
sea of shadows and wisps of smoke.  The walls are chipping, pink brick with
a cool white neon sign behind the stage; the brick does a spectacular job
absorbing the cacophony of brass, string, and percussion instruments that
pound through the club from sundown 'til dawn.  The waitresses that drift
about the room with round cork trays have adapted to using facial
expressions and hand gestures to communicate with customers; the music is
too loud for verbal cues.  Couples on the dance floor are dressed in ties
and dresses.  The rest populate round tables and the long bar, sipping
drinks and contributing the haze of smoke.  The bar curves around the
western wall, manned by an elderly Creole in a pressed black shirt.  The
waitresses and the band all dress in kind.  The floor is black varnished
wood with a high gloss.

#pZ'Otz Coffee and Tea House #e-#p (#eAvg. NPCs#p:#e 10#p)#n~
Z'Otz provides a welcome haven for the city's displaced bohemian
congregation, who have been at a loss for a cafe due to the insurgence of
corporate coffee shops with sterile decor and no-smoking policies.  Housed
in one of the older buildings on Royal Street, the coffeehouse has exposed
beams and original walls with decades of fading paint.  Flowers and plants
spill over the glitter dusted sidewalk, and a scarlet passionflower vine
creeps up the power lines into the patio.  Cozy sofas and antique armchairs
are filled with people lounging, reading, studying or just relaxing with
their beverages of choice.  The crowd is mixed, boasting everyone from
college students to parents.  This place emulates that certain magic the
French Quarter has.  A cast of regulars includes local authors, playwrights,
gallery owners, producers, designers and film makers.  Tourists rarely find
their way to Z'Otz, preferring the familiarity of Starbucks or other more
reputable establishments.

The only access to the rooftop is the rather decrepit ladders descending
to the ever-distinct metal fire escapes, though judging by their state they
are not often used at all.  The place is as one would expect of such a
building; the stone is old and weatherworn, edging around the small
enclosure like a mockery of a castle.  Little is actually up on this
particular building, save for a large television antennae and several broken
slates.  The large black-tiled roof looms along-side of it threateningly,
that being the lid of the majority of the building, and judging by the many
loose slates it is in need of some degree of repair.  A decent view of
Toulouse Street can be attained by standing here.

#oOur Lady of Guadalupe Chapel#n~
Dense cobwebs obscure passage through the half-rotted boards that once
kept the wide double-doors shut.  The pews running up to the altar are
creaky and coated in a film of dust, still standing by the force of sheer
will.  A walkway three feet wide leads up to the dais, upon which stone
pedestals hold statues of Saint Expedite and Saint Jude.  The statues rest
upon moth-eaten cloths of white, making clear it was the Easter season when
the chapel was abandoned.  Draping from the high vaulted ceiling are
tendrils of cobwebs.  Intricate stained glass windows depict biblical
scenes, though many are at least partially shattered.  The little shards of
colored glass now lay on the ground, unceremoniously forgotten by the
windows they once filled.  Mounted above the altar dais is a massive cross
with a gruesome depiction of the crucified savior.  Stone droplets of blood
drip down his hallowed brow from behind a thorny crown.

#BBlue Cypress Books (Avg. NPCs: 11)#n~
The walls are painted a fresh robin's egg blue with accents of cheerful
yellow and brick running up the corners, showing the foundation of the
building underneath.  Shelves of a light-weight pale wood form five aisles,
segregating one portion of the store to browsing for the books that fill
them.  The front window is large and covers most of the building's face,
reading 'Blue Cypress Books' in a fun hand-painted font, blue outlined in
white; the familiar blue cypress tree is painted on after the word 'blue',
and on the half-dome shape top of the window reads 'buy - sell - trade' in
the same hand-painted font.  Squat tables from any number of collections are
arranged through the more open half of the room, many with deco flowers
painted on their folding leaves.  A few groups cluster around these tables
in mismatching chairs, reading and debating what they read.  Many people
browse the shelves on their own, buying or going to find a solitary seat
somewhere in the shop to read.  Coupons for free Z'Otz Coffee and Tea are
handed out at the counter for making certain purchases on certain days,
following a definite theme in time with local, national and world events;
during times of crisis with China buying a book on Taoism or Chinese culture
might get a customer a free drink, or while debates rage about stem-cell
research a book on genetics or biology might.  The floor is a pale hard wood
and many framed pictures of any old random thing line the walls in no
particular order.

`BFire escape from roof of Club Hemlock`n~
A very old, creaky structure composed of heavily rusting, only marginally
safe reddish iron with a grate foor a place to rest one's feet.  The rear
face of the building this ancient fire escape snakes up is utterly darkened,
vine-choked brick; the same vines form a sparse wrap about the metal rungs
of the ladder, occasionally giving way to a tiny splash of wilting color
where the rare flower manages to bloom before the definite lack of available
sunlight quashes it out.  The building stretches high toward the night sky,
blocking any hope of moonlight from being discerned.

#rCourtyard, The #RS#raint Phillips Apartments #R(#rAvg NPCs#R:#r3#R)#n~
A stereotypical French Quarter courtyard in a combination of French
Creole and Spanish styles, complete with an enclosing gate and touches of
greenery.  The apartments are independent from one another, sharing the
courtyard, gardens and laundry facilities, but nothing else.  Singular
apartment homes lie on each side of the courtyard.  The gate to the west
leads onto Royal Street.

#gA small ill-beaten path surrounded by ominous foliage#n~
A brutal degree of trees, vines, and an assortment of various other
plants hang here presenting a rather extraordinary, if not frightening
visage.  To the north the trail leads back out of the foliage and to the
south there appears to be a large carriage its paint thinning with age,
surrounded by the ill-natured growth of the plants that reside here.

#RAn Abandoned Parking Garage#n~
This is a very large, enclosed area that was once the ground floor of a
parking garage, prior to the devastating effects of one hurricane or another
- now it sees no traffic; the hard cement drives which had allowed vehicles
passage now lie boarded and barricaded, and the only entrance is a noisey
aluminum swing-up garage-styled door with a few rusty padlocks attached. 
Despite it's apparant lack of technical use it seems fairly intact,
something that cannot be said for the many levels above the bottom floor;
the cement ground and ceiling looks almost fresh, as though it had been
recently added, very thick with a rough estimate of perhaps ten feet or so
in depth on either side.  Paved columns are calculatedly spaced across the
massive expanse of the parking garage, these too reinforced with fresh
layers of concrete.  There are a dozen or so abandoned cars parked or more
incidentally piled in one corner, most of them severely dented up and
damaged beyond any thought of repair, and one wall is completely covered in
large water barrels - the ones used at busy intersections and on freeways to
prevent vehicles from experiancing excessive collision damage.  Here and
there graffiti has been sprayed onto the bare grey walls, depicting the
occasional 'fuck,' 'I love Margret' or 'Andy was here.  ' There appears to
be something of a place to gather at the center, rather like a large, empty
arena with a shallow pit in the middle filled with cigarette butts.

#gA colossal sized carriage#n~
A large carriage resides here, pressed between two massive weeping
willows that gift the area a chilling semblance with the constant flow of
falling willowed leaves.  The plants here gather about the carriage and
slowly curve about it, as it appears the carriage has now started to collect
about the wheels of the carriage holding it in place.

#rLittle Darlings (Avg. NPCs: 32)#n~
Heavy metal doors of brushed steel swirl-pattern part to assault the
senses with flashing, strobing, swirling lights that dance and flicker
across the expansive polished wood floor, catching the eye through a haze of
smoke and heady aroma of liquor, sweat and desire.  Walls painted a deep
matte black, seems to suck up the glare from the neon bombshells that hang
perched there as an enticing backdrop, giving a seamless line where it
touches the floor.  Floor to ceiling mirrors, shadowed with a gray haze
about the edges, cover the entire back wall and the ceiling, reversing the
room and lighting back on itself to give a 360 view of the entertainment. 
Three large under lit catwalk stages, rimmed with amber tinted rope lights
and a low wooden ledge for drinks, offer up entertainment across the main
body of the floor, high-backed red velvet stools ringing them for those who
wish to get an up close and personal view.  A rounded metal topped bar cuts
an oasis in the very center of the room sunken three steps below the main
floor, small raised platforms topped with shiny steal poles and cages give a
vertical break from the round form now and again, offering eye candy in
various states of dress and movement.  An elevated DJ cage of clear tempered
glass, backlit with pulsing lights is nestled at a lofty height near the
largest of the stages, thumping out the grinding beat, or silky sexy strains
as two slinky bodies pulse to either side, framing it.  Red velvet covered
doors lead off in the cardinal directions leading to private rooms, the rest
rooms, and staff only areas.  A raised balcony skirts the room on three
sides, offering secluded alcoves dotted with booths, leopard print sofas and
club chairs in a smooth black harlequin pattern.

#rDressing Room at Little Darlings#n~
This lengthy room, tucked back beneath the main stage is a mish-mash of
dressing tables, strewn with cosmetics and body paint, half discarded
costumes and sweaty bodies sliding into slinky garments just before the next
dance.  Battered dressing screens painted with garish scenes block off
corners, draped in stockings and garters they obscure a dull set of dinged
gray metal lockers, names written on white tape denoting owners.  Hard back
chairs offer a seat before the dressing table mirrors taped with photos and
mementos to give a bit of personal flair.  Stark white walls offer little
interest, paired with a worn green carpet dotted with dark stains here and
there, the heavy smell of baby oil and apple blossom perfume hanging heavy
in the air.

Sagging chain-link fencing connects to a warehouse here and has a set of
double-gates where delivery trucks can load and unload at the large cement
dock.  Vines and other such untended foliage grow up along the fence quickly
and appear to thrive, having something to curl around to stay out of the
constant puddles at the base of the fence along the sidewalk.

The mournful sound of a ship horn echoes around the brick buildings
lining either side of this dimly lit street.  Cars and people aren't
frequent in this area, but still can be seen driving or walking through from
time to time.  The bright lights and noise of the calle de bourbon have been
left behind in this place of older and mostly commercial brick buildings.

`BRoof of Club Hemlock`n~
The only access to the rooftop is the rather decrepit ladders descending
to the ever-distinct metal fire escapes, though judging by their state they
are not often used at all.  The place is as one would expect of such a
building; the stone is old and weatherworn, edging around the small
enclosure like a mockery of a castle.  Little is actually up on this
particular building, save for a large television antennae and several broken
slates.  The large black-tiled roof looms along-side of it threateningly,
that being the lid of the majority of the building, and judging by the many
loose slates it is in need of some degree of repair.  A decent view of
Toulouse Street can be attained by standing here.

Walls draped in thick falls of rich crimson velvet flank a raised wooden
dais, four leveled steps from the floor.  A single, black leather armless
chair occupies a throne like position on the wooden platform, the hot seat
for many a private lap dance.  The fabric drenched walls dull the thrumming
and din of the outer rooms, making a private world all its own.  Speakers
dot the ceiling, leading back to a cabinet encased cd player topped with a
mirrored drink caddy, thick leaded glass bottles holding varied amber
colored liquids.  Mood lighting keeps a smooth sexy vibe to the air, dimmed
with a simple flick of the switch.  A single slim metal pole, with a
gleaming bronze finish cuts the only sharp vertical angle in the room,
making a tempting play thing for nimble bodies.  The deep red door leads
back toward the main room.

The colored tile continues on here but it is not as elaborate as before,
merely set here for simplicity purposes.  Several tables have been set up
along with chairs and a few long benches are here as well giving plenty of
room for those who wish to study.  It also has a small section for any
'classes' that wish to be held here and those chairs are pushed off to the
side to keep from the general populas not wanting to disturb them of course.

of concrete with yellow painting seperating different parking spaces.  A
cardboard box or two sit near the back of the lot against one of the run
down buildings.  Broken bottles of booze can be seen scattered about.

#rIntersection of Prytania and St. Charles Avenue#n~
The languid comforts of ordered willow tree rows, great lawns of emerald
grass and historic, gorgeous plantation homes neatly frame the wide
cobblestone lanes of the Garden District.  Iron corn-husk gates run the
perimeter of many of the Spanish courtyards, though perfect hedges, rows of
old-growth trees and fashionable antique bollards are just as common.  The
wealth of The Garden District is responsible for its incredible beauty, but
it's hard to hold that fact against it while walking the wide cobblestoned
lanes, drinking in the staggering elegance of the historic homes and
manicured courtyards, breathing the clean air and smelling hints of wild
lavender instead of smog.  The Garden District is an oasis for the rich; an
oasis that welcomes outsiders to come and partake, albeit temporarily, of
their relief.  A winding driveway leads from black wrought iron gates to the
dark double doors of a plantation home mansion to the south.  Elegant
statues loom on either side.

its existance.  And still others utilize this room for the learning of

#bThe Garden#n~
Through high iron gates a marble path leads its meandering way on through
a picturesque garden.  All around roses of different shapes and sizes have
been planted, some are blood red, others are the light blue of moonlight. 
The garden appears to be bordered by huge rosebushes that tower above even
the imposing outer fence, their plethora of red flowers making them resemble
a red speckled carpet of life.  Further along the path widens in to a
circular commons encircling a man-sized fountain topped by a single rose. 
The plant appears to grow right out of the icy water, its roots covering the
geometric stone monument chaotically.  All around are white marble benches
punctuated here and there by a chess set or a young oak tree.  Through the
mist of the fountain a Greco-roman style villa can be seen, its marble
columns extending above the foliage.

#bThe Main Hall#n~
Through the massive doorway an equally massive room awaits.  The floors
are a mixture of red and white marble and the walls have been masterfully
painted with scenes of all sorts, mostly of sea scenes and ships at sail. 
The vaulting ceiling is painted with the appearance of clouds and sunlight. 
Almost too hard to see, tiny birds or perhaps angels, flit between the
billowing clouds.  The room looks large enough to be used for major events
or dances and has obviously been designed with acoustics in mind considering
there is a large #bharp#n located in the room as well.  There is a raised
alcove in one wall that looks to be well suited to the placement of
entertainment and twin carpeted staircases lead to a balcony, which
overlooks the room.  Below the balcony is a door similar to the entryway
leads on, at the rear of the balcony is a somewhat smaller door.

#rIntersection of Toledano and Carondelet Street#n~
The languid comforts of ordered willow tree rows, great lawns of emerald
grass and historic, gorgeous plantation homes neatly frame the wide
cobblestone lanes of the Garden District.  Iron corn-husk gates run the
perimeter of many of the Spanish courtyards, though perfect hedges, rows of
old-growth trees and fashionable antique bollards are just as common.  The
wealth of The Garden District is responsible for its incredible beauty, but
it's hard to hold that fact against it while walking the wide cobblestoned
lanes, drinking in the staggering elegance of the historic homes and
manicured courtyards, breathing the clean air and smelling hints of wild
lavender instead of smog.  The Garden District is an oasis for the rich; an
oasis that welcomes outsiders to come and partake, albeit temporarily, of
their relief.

#bThe Dining Hall#n~
This hall is slightly smaller though longer than the Main Hall; a long
table of polished wood surrounded by numerous chairs dominates it.  The most
prominent feature of this room is the far wall, which is dominated by huge
glass #bwindows#n, which look out onto the city and the harbour.  All along
the walls tapestries depict historical events and battles, mostly Roman or
Greek victories.  A small door to one side is subtly set into the wall, but
not so much to as to be invisible to casual observation.  Wall sconces
contain oil lamps of intricate design, which shed a soft steady light on the
room.  A small #bspy#n glass also lies in the corner by the window.

of tasty looking stuff and a sizeable wine collection.

This balcony overlooks the main hall.  A stone railing extends in a U
shape up the side of each staircase and across the front of the balcony. 
Here a better look at the painted ceiling is possible.  Up close the
painting looks even more masterful, every wisp of cloud looks so real it
seems almost to drift through its blue paint sky.  Red carpet covers the
balcony and stairways.  A small door in the wall opposite the main hall
entrance leads north.

and surmounted by a large #bpainting#n of a rose.  Against the opposite wall
sits a massive #bdesk#n flanked by equally massive bookshelves packed with
all sort and manner of volumes.  At the far end of the room two windows look
out over the city of Cordoba, truly a magnificent sight.

This painting of a rose blossom is exquisite; the droplets of moisture on

between the petals.  The colour of the rose changes in a circle, from white,
to light red, to blood red, and back to white.

A Garden~
Obviously, this place is a Garden, with a gravel path, leading southwards
towards the main Mansion, which looks foreboding and large at first sight,
while a path leads off eastwards, to what must be the stables.  As the sound
of horses can be heard in that direction also, at the sides of the Path are
Rose bushes, exuding a powerful, but beautiful smell, while the grass itself
is well cared for.

a Stable, with the horse muck being cleaned out regularly.  There is one
exit, leading back out towards the Gardens, that's why the path is so wide,
so the horses can be taken across it.

The Atrium~
This atrium is rather large and imposing.  It is a dark room filled with
many paintings and sculptures dating back to what it looks the Greco-Roman
era.  A smooth marble floor is here, with a few thick rugs from Thessalonia
laid on the ground.  A large and wide staircase leads up to the first floor
of the mansion.  Wide arched doorways are on both west and east sides of the
Atrium, leading to different sections of the mansion.  In the middle of the
Atrium is a statue of the Greek hero Odysseus standing ready to strike with
his sword.

leading to a single large heavy looking door, and one smaller looking door
to the east.  The room has beautiful laid patterns of marble in the ground,
the lighting in this windowless area is provided by elegant brass
candelabras set into wall sconces.  Various paintings of men and woman
standing heroic poses are displayed; along with many sculptures of
individuals not know by you.  The large looking door at the end of the
hallway has a large crest on it.

The coarse, weathered urban mass that is Canal Street slowly slips into
distant memory, giving a whole new meaning to the phrase 'Out of sight, out
of mind' for residents in the Garden District.  The towering grey stone
buildings and seedy atmosphere is gradually replaced by the languid comforts
of ordered willow tree rows, great lawns of emerald grass and historic,
gorgeous plantation homes.  Iron corn-husk gates run the perimeter of many
of the Spanish courtyards, though perfect hedges, rows of old-growth trees
and fashionable antique bollards are just as common.  The wealth of The

it a large beautiful mirror.  A few paintings are hanging on the walls, most
noticeable a painting with a single man working on a field, and a man on
horseback, with a whip in his hand.  Writing in the frame in Latin, it says
"The workers nightmare".  A nice looking sofa is seen next to a bookcase
filled with an assortment of writings.  The room looks very neat and

High stone walls crowned with spires of iron circle the Lafeyette
Cemetary.  Burials in these acres of lawn-coated marshland date to the
nineteeth century, with elaborate mausoleums, historic tombs and a hundred
rows of complex stones.  Labyrinthine paths weave through the grounds,
skirting through shrubberies and hedges that show surprising signs of
neglect.  The mausoleums have many cracked or open doors; by now, most have
been ransacked or explored.  Disturbances in the dust and broken chains that
once held these doors closed attest to their invasion.  Though the majority
of historical cemeteries in New Orleans are well-maintained, the Lafeyette
has an air of fresh disregard.  Despite the foliage pregnant with passion
blooms and dozens of old growth cypress, it still smells of death.

Leaving behind you the fortified doors, you see a large and beautiful
bedroom, made with the utmost care and love.  A beautiful thick carpet is
laid on the ground and a large mirror is to the west of the room.  A large
bed is to the far east of the room; above it is the same crest as on the
door leading into this room.  Two swords cross each other, and a roaring
lion is displayed above the crossing swords.  There is a large painting to
the west almost covering the entire wall.  The painting portrays the
destroyed city of Carthage in its best state, truly a marvellous sight to
behold.  There are a few comfortable looking velvet sofas next to a bookcase
and a table with a game of extraordinary looking chess pieces.  A nicely
carved wooden stand is placed on one side of the wall displaying various
weapons, and chain-mail armour that looks old, but still sturdy and ready to
be used if needed.

The only access to the rooftop is the rather decrepit ladders descending
to the ever-distinct metal fire escapes, though judging by their state they
are not often used at all.  The place is as one would expect of such a
building; the stone is old and weatherworn, edging around the small
enclosure like a mockery of a castle.  Little is actually up on this
particular building, save for a large television antennae and several broken
slates.  The large black-tiled roof looms along-side of it threateningly,
that being the lid of the majority of the building, and judging by the many
loose slates it is in need of some degree of repair.  A decent view of
Toulouse Street can be attained by standing here.

A Dining Room~
You enter the main dining room of this mansion.  There is a large table
carved out of a beautiful wood not seen often.  Many chairs surround the
large long squire table, and a beautiful chandelier, with some unlit
candles, is hanging above it.  There are thick Iberian carpets on the
ground, and a large painting of the owner of the mansion is to the east side
of the room.  You can see two exits in this room, one going west and back to
the atrium, the other one leading south to what it seems by the smell of it,
the kitchen.

suitable for your drinking and eating needs.  There is a bar along the east
wall of this room where drinks are served.  A server can be seen darting to
and from the doors behind the bar in the northeast corner of the room that
lead to the kitchen.  A few tables and chairs are placed in this room and
people can be seen conversing, drinking, and playing card games and the like
all around.  To the north of here is the common room where you can be seated
to eat or drink your fill.

been ransacked or explored.  Disturbances in the dust and broken chains that
once held these doors closed attest to their invasion.  Though the majority
of historical cemeteries in New Orleans are well-maintained, the Lafeyette
has an air of fresh disregard.  Despite the foliage pregnant with passion
blooms and dozens of old growth cypress, it still smells of death.

The Common Room of the Taberna~
You are in the common room of the Taberna del Cazador Borracho.  The
scene is dominated by a large fireplace and a number of sturdy tables and
chairs are set up around the room.  The floor here is tiled with an
attractive sand colored tile.  This place appears to be quite busy most of
the time because of its prime location, and many people can be seen entering
and leaving in a fairly short time.  The arched opening to the south leads
to the bar, and appears to be the only exit as this room stretches the
length of the building.

#rThe French Market#n~
The river wall blocks any view of the boardwalk or Mississippi River from
the area, which after dark transforms from a bustling, old-fashioned
farmer's market with fresh vegetables, crawfish, homemade gumbo, voodoo
implements and questionable delectables like crocodile sausages intermingled
with standing coolers packed with various commercial beverages like Pepsi or
IBC Rootbeer to darker sorts of merchants carting in their wares; there is
no better place in New Orleans, save for perhaps the Square, to find a more
thorough selection of black market commerce.  For the most part, no wares
are out for display after dark, leaving the numerous booths and stalls
occupied by lone individuals with wheeled, closed and often locked cases who
wait on customers looking for them rather than attempting to entice anybody
passing by.  The sole exception are the vodoun booths, where men and women
peddle off little luck trinkets, charms or various gris-gris.  North leads
onto Decatur Street, and west the footpaths back onto the Mississippi
Boardwalk.

#gPath to the monastery and dojo#n~
The wooden path over the swamps is about eight inches above the murky
water line.  The Cyprus trees are abundant here; towering high above the
path allowing it to be perfectly shaded.  The cool breeze can be felt across
your face as you continue down the path.  To the north you can see a split
in the path.  The path continues north, and to the east you can see a large
building on raised earth.  A sign is at the corner where the two paths meet.
The sign reads, "This way to the Dojo of Shaolin Do" with an arrow pointing
east.

#eThe Eight Ball #n(#eAvg. NPCs: 10#e)#n~
The faint, musty odors of old tobacco and cheap liquor fills the heavy
air.  Tables are arranged in an orderly fashion, and each table has four
chairs.  Whether or not they match is another story, and most have a layer
of dust from lack of use.  A long bar extends across the back wall,
shielding various liquors and drink mixes from public view.  A dirty rag is
left on the bar from what looks like an attempt to clean.  Grimey mugs and
glasses are stacked in a tub at the far end of the bar, waiting to be
washed.  A few pool tables are placed on one side of the bar, providing
added challenges to pool players as they try to navigate the pitted and
damaged felts.  The balls, however, are not missing like in normal bars of
this type - they're chipped and worn from over use and poor care, but
they're here.  A soft fluorescent glow falls from the ceiling; just enough
light to stop customers walking into tables.

here are are beautiful with no signs of the moss so populace here.  At the
end of the path you can see a large clearing full of light if the sun is
shining.  If it is night, or cloudy, you will see a large stone building
with huge double doors.  And torches lit to either side of the doors.

#pA French Quarter alleyway#n~
There is a moderate alley space between two freshly painted, pale pink
apartment buildings.  Whorls of trash flutter here and there, scraps of
paper, plastic candy wrappers, a few dry leaves from the native cypress and
skinny willows.  The alley is a quiet dead end, sitting empty but for a
mundane dumpster near the very back.  The dumpster rests inert against the
brick of an old wall, missing one of its wheeled legs so that it lies
off-center, partially tipped over.  Dark orchids grow in the hot moist
places under the dumpster, and in the creases at the foundations of the
buildings.

#pAnnabelle's Hollow#n~
Climb inside the dumpster and knock six times on the sweet spot.  The
door opens to an azure sky with white clouds that lay like pillows over the
wet yellow sun.  Go headfirst into the sky and you fall, but only until your
feet are on level with the ground.  The door is gone in that moment,
replaced by a quaint, closed wooden hatch.  The entire world seems to flip
around.  You're no longer upside down - the sky was above you all along. 
Acres of virgin snow stretch out all around, glistening like diamonds in the
heatless sun.  Shallow slopes of white that may or may not have earth
beneath them frame miles of snow filled with frozen flowers.  Dainty
Hellebore, Snowdrops, Cape Primrose and Lady Slipper Orchids adorn the
meadow of snow with a wintry palette of blue, pale violet, white and the
occasional yellow.  Purple winterbloom forms a crown around the dark wood
legs of a pale pink sofa.

#eAn abandoned Victorian home#n~
The smell of must and mildew permeate this abandoned home and very little
light shines through the boarded up windows, giving it a rather oppressive,
claustrophobic feel.  Various moldy, nearly unrecognizable paintings of the
civil war and wartime ornaments adorn this home, giving it an eerie sort of
elegance.  An oriental rug covers the floor, it's corners having been gnawed
away by generations upon generations of rodent families occupying the walls
of this house, evident from the holes that seem to have been chewed through
them, exposing the support beams holding this remnant of the past upright
along with what remains of what was once a noble looking couch, now having
suffered a similar fate as the walls, serving as a nest for rats.  A small
kitchen sits to the west, containing a rusted oven and exposed and barren
cupboards, the doors of them having long fallen off.  There are stairs
leading upward, although they have been blocked due to the upper floor
beginning to collapse, as debris and wood seem to trickle all the way down
the stairs, stopping at the base of them.

adorned with all sorts of training weapons on the walls.  Any weapon you can
think of for any east Asian martial arts can be found on weapon racks upon
the walls.  The entire floor is padded for protection purposes.  Ironically,
there are no chairs here.  In the far right corner there are three wooden
dummies setup with padding along the center pole.  In the left corner there
is a speed bag, and standard punching bag.  In the back is a red door.

#eA dark steel chamber#n~
Darkness permeates this cold, steel chamber and although one wouldn't
know where it ends or where it begins by looking, it goes about ten feet in
any direction, appearing to be built into the foundation of the house.  One
must crawl in order to move down here and the air is very still.  A strange
smell permeates the air down here as well, the smell of soil although there
is none by what one's senses would divulge.  Detail any security measures on
the home, haven or business: Nothing, aside from the place where Mikhail
actually rests, which consists of a 10x10 reinforced steel 'box' where he
sleeps.  Detail any weapons, cash or other items of interest found on the
premises and where they are kept: Nothing at all, he does not keep evidence,
or mementos around that would indicate that someone actually lives here.

dirt to be found.  There is no AC here, but the monastery is still cooler
then the outside.  There is a nice breeze that is always blowing through,
not to mention the stone of the monastery helps to keep the heat at bay.  To
the immediate left and right are large doors.  To the north the foyer
continues.  A large set of stairs leading up in the center, splitting off
into two directions about ten feet up.  Above you can see a balcony half way

Moonlight gently cascades through the multitude of the large stoic oak
trees that drip with Spanish moss.  The driveway is majestically long and
the trees canopy over each other to create a living dome.  The trees
themselves seem to have been here for centuries.  The lawn smells and looks
as though it has just been cut, and the boundaries against the gate and
manse are constantly patrolled by roaming peacocks.  The plantation itself
is immense, stoic and grand, reminiscent of a century past.  A large Greek
revival styled, has huge Doric columns supporting the expansive front porch.
Large dark oak wooden doors, obviously French in design and upon them are
polished brass peacock feather doorknockers.

reads "We thank you for being hit round the head if you are Smoking" In the
centre of the Ring there is a crudely drawn smiley face, whilst a banner
bearing a much better picture of the same smiley face hangs on the back
wall.  Underneath the banner a door marked "Happy's Office" leads north
whilst to the west some double doors lead to a martial arts room.

`cHope and Faith Community Health Center`e [`cAvg`e.`c NPCs`e:`c 11`e]`n~
The Hope and Faith Health Center is one of the few free health clinics
here in New Orleans.  Locally funded and operated, the building serves as a
sort of jewel for many of the unfortunate and poor souls in the surrounding
community.  Two large, glass doors lead the way into the reception area and
waiting room.  The room is small and quaint with four rows of chairs lined
up along the western wall.  A large counter on the Eastern wall is where
many of the junior staff and nurses work, handling paperwork, telephone
calls, inquiries, and other such business.  The room is brightly lit by a
score of light panels illuminating from the low ceiling, the combination of
windows, white floor tiles, and a wall painted with bright green.  Several
hallways line the northern all, leading to storage and private rooms along
with the offices of several of the doctors employed here.  Restrooms can be
found right by the guest waiting room, over next to the chairs.  The place
always appear to have a handful of patients and staff alike waiting for
service.  To the left of the entrance is an office door to the owner. 
Furthermore, just around the corner from the counter is another door leading
down to the basement level and is locked requiring, oddly, three different
keys to open it.

banner showing either an eight spoked wheel or a lotus flower.  In the left
hand corner lies a pair of broomsticks and a small dustpan, to the right a
bucket containing rubber knives and wooden staves leans against the corner.

`cHope and Faith Community Health Center `e(`cBasement`e)#n~
The basement is nearly as spacious as the building it sits under.  Cold
concrete floor and red brick, windowless walls sums this place up.  Most
supplies are tucked away to one side  near the stairs  featuring a number
of assorted items that didn't belong top side.  Old crates and furniture
gone unused.  In one corner is a twin-sized bed, mini-cooler, nightstand and
a small TV setup on a table barely large enough to hold it.  Far on the
other side, along the northern wall, are several large racks that house
powerful computer servers, all humming quietly.  Several computers also line
the walls with large, bulky monitors.  To the left are a few tables with
various items strewn about from tubes to flasks to measuring devices and
assorted notes.  Several cooling units are stationed throughout and two
large freezers make up a single corner.  Center of all these tables and
monitors hanging from the ceiling is a large, circular platform with a giant
tube with various wires feeding into it and steam leaving exhaust vents that
encircle it in small portions, giving the basement an almost eternal fog
that blankets the floor up to a foot high.  Kept at about forty degrees at
all times, the place is dark and brooding with a feint, although horrible
scent.

`rApartment 2B on Dauphin`n~
The apartment breeds a sense of masculinity, though rather than a typical
bachelor pad it carries with it the singularity of male youth, particularly
in the choice of decor.  The furniture is clean but moreso comfortable,
chosen for that reason if it was chosen at all; the pieces don't match,
making it unlikely they were bought at the same time or for the same
purpose.  The television is large and set up in a stainless steel,
industrial-looking entertainment center with a few DVDs stacked in disorder
on the shelves.  The apartment isn't great looking overall, though there's
nothing filthy or trashy about it; it's simply not the kind of place you
have to shell out a ton of money to live in.  The walls are painted red and
covered in posters, most of them obscure bands or unpopular movies.  The
kitchen is tiny, the biggest appliance being the fridge.  A stack of pizza
boxes sits on the counter and the sink has several dishes in it, mostly
glasses.  The couch is thick and cushy but covered in piles of laundry;
thankfully it's all clean, and proving this are several dryer sheets
intermingled with the boxer shorts, t-shirts and jeans.  The floor is a
plain beige berber carpet with few stains.  An airing closet holds blankets,
sheets and towels, and a door thinner than the one leading into the
apartment opens to the bedroom.

is a rollmat surrounded by curtains with another shrine situated behind it.

This massive, warehouse-sized room contains six, large lifts, each meant
to lift cars or trucks of various sizes several feet off the concrete floor.
Each lift is enclosed with stacks of toolboxes, piles of discarded auto
parts on rolling carts, electric sockets and air hoses hanging from the
extremely high ceiling, and various wayward gloves, and welding masks.  Only
four of the lifts contain vehicles, which are held, like trophies, in the
air, each in its own state of disassembly and disarray.  Coke machines, some
oil-stained couches, safety posters, and calendars with cars and scantily
clad women line the walls.  There's an enclosed room with few windows in the
back, with gas masks hanging from the outside windows and posters on the
doors demanding you wear them inside.  The door to the office, to the west,
lays between several large panes of glass.

longer wall, adorned with mismatched throw pillows.  A small kitchenette
fits snugly along the far wall, hosting chipped, stained, and seemingly
randomly chosen kitchenware, which nevertheless dry on the counter, next to
a vase of humble flowers.  A coffee table stands proudly in the middle of
the room, about knee-high, below a softly whirring and dully slowing ceiling
fan.  A pair of doors parallel the kitchen, one leading to a modestly tiled
bathroom, another to a bedroom.

with bits of clothing peaking out from inside.  A closet door hangs
perpetually open, the inside brimming with hangers and cardboard boxes of
assorted things, towels dangling from the doorknob.  Where there would be
space is a peculiar bit of memorabilia: a presumably life-sized anvil, on
which rests strange, modern interpretations of smith's tools, and a stack of
books of graphic paper, notebooks, rulers, and drafting implements.

The door has the name Emporium of Wonder written in shimmery gold, the
gothic script printed in a shallow arc.  The shop is a larger one, slightly
wider than the shotgun style buildings which pepper Bourbon Street, possibly
a warehouse of sorts before the owner converted it.  Inside one is first
overwhelmed by the sheer amount of knick-knacks, wind-ups, stuffed creatures
and porcelain figurines packing the shelves and walls.  The counter is
cartoonishly large, crafted of old wood and has a collection of odd robot
toys, bears of stuffed velveteen and a few dozen human-looking figures
standing at attention behind it.  A sign over the cash register hangs from
brass chains, and details the prices of the week's most popular wares. 
There is a binder on the counter with sheets for requesting custom made
toys.  The cash register is very old, something dropped out of a steampunk
graphic novel with its large pull handle, big buttons and ka-ching when the
drawer snaps open.

base of the owner's mind and his obsession with the machines that govern his
waking and dreaming life surround those who come here like a wallpaper; this
is his temple to the god of machines.

gigantic, ancient trees, and dozens of yards to the south is a parking lot,
filled with cars of all types.  Gas-lit lamps line a cobbled sidewalk that
winds through the near middle of the grassy knoll.  Towards the east, a
tall, stucco-walled building with deep red brick walls and long glass
windows enforced by salmon pink metal bars can be seen.

#GTulane University Campus#n~
A broad, cypress shaded U-shape surrounds the massive main building of
the University.  The space is large enough to act as home to numerous
gigantic, ancient trees, and dozens of yards to the south is a parking lot,
filled with cars of all types.  Gas-lit lamps line a cobbled sidewalk that
winds through the near middle of the grassy knoll.  A quaint little red
brick building, slightly wider than the usual shotgun-style structures of
the era in which it was built, sits to the west of the campus entrance,
allowing for a constant flow of students with convenience to their
schedules.  #pThe Lory's Nest#n is printed in a vibrant spectrum of colours
over the front window, and the door opens to the chime of a bird-like bell. 
Through the window books are perused around tables and baked goods are
bought and devoured.  Baking pastries and other delectable scents are a
powerful drawing point to the entrance.

`nB`Blue `nC`Bypress `nB`Book`ns `B(Avg. NPCs: 11)~
The walls are painted a fresh robin's egg blue with accents of cheerful
yellow and brick running up the corners, showing the foundation of the
building underneath.  Shelves of a light-weight pale wood form five aisles,
segregating one portion of the store to browsing for the books that fill
them.  The front window is large and covers most of the building's face,
reading 'Blue Cypress Books' in a fun hand-painted font, blue outlined in
white; the familiar blue cypress tree is painted on after the word 'blue',
and on the half-dome shape top of the window reads 'buy - sell - trade' in
the same hand-painted font.  Squat tables from any number of collections are
arranged through the more open half of the room, many with deco flowers
painted on their folding leaves.  A few groups cluster around these tables
in mismatching chairs, reading and debating what they read.  Many people
browse the shelves on their own, buying or going to find a solitary seat
somewhere in the shop to read.  Coupons for free Z'Otz Coffee and Tea are
handed out at the counter for making certain purchases on certain days,
following a definite theme in time with local, national and world events;
during times of crisis with China buying a book on Taoism or Chinese culture
might get a customer a free drink, or while debates rage about stem-cell
research a book on genetics or biology might.  The floor is a pale hard wood
and many framed pictures of any old random thing line the walls in no
particular order.

`pThe Lory`g'`ps Nest `g(`pAvg`g.`p NPCs`g:`p 28`g)`n~
Over the door a little bell with a bird-like chime announces to the room
when newcomers arrive.  The architectural details of the wall supports and
exposed ceilings are coloured like the Painted Ladies of San Francisco, each
facet a different complimentary hue with old red brick taking up the
wallspace inbetween.  The lights hang low, the modern chandeliers brushed
steel with pastel globes of frosted glass around the bulbs.  Wider than the
other shotgun-style buildings in the French Quarter, the front room is large
enough to split down the center, dedicating one half to shelving and the
other to a bakery.  Displays with a few fingerprints on the glass enclosures
hold trays of petit fours, douch poffert, palmiers and countless other
confectionaries; from shortcrust to phyllo pastries there are limitless
items to suit anybody's sweet-tooth, each placed upon an airy paper doily. 
Slices of torte are offered for free tasting on the counter, individually
cut and pierced with toothpicks for easy pick-up.  Plain old black coffee is
served at the bakery, offering little more fancy than a touch of honey or
cream.  The bakery gives the building it's famous scent, pulsing with the
delicious odors of crisp chocolates and sugars, warm cinnamon, baking doughs
and rich fruit fillings.  The other side of the Lory is filled by shelves;
pale wood and steel supports reach to the ceiling, lined with books from
every genre.  By design the bookshop is easy to get lost in.  Rolling
ladders are in use for reaching books on the higher shelves.  The brick
walls are papered with historical playbills with watercolor faces gazing
gaily outward, ads for local bands and performers and a few random oddities.
Fat and brightly coloured furniture is scattered absolutely everywhere,
often with a stout table set beside or in front of the pieces.

`pThe Lory`g'`ps Nest`g -`p Kitchens`n~
The kitchen floors are checkered with large black and white tiles, often
coated by a fine sheen of flour dust with shoe-prints in the places commonly
trekked upon.  Long flourescent lights run across the ceiling, making the
kitchen suitably bright for detail-work.  There are a mere four burners on
the stove-top, leaving more space for the walls of ovens.  Handmade and oft
ill-matching pot-holders hang in individual pairs from hooks beside each
oven for easy grabbing.  A vast fridgeration unit is sealed with glass
doors, holding creams, frostings, custards and jellies, many already sealed
snugly inside plastic piping bags awaiting use.  Stainless steel countertops
are centered toward the center of the kitchen, allowing access to all of the
supplies and facilities from anywhere on the counter.  There are two marble
boards to roll out dough and a pastry brake to reduce the thickness of
pre-baked pastry componants.  The blender has a plastic wisk attachment and
has been secluded to a corner, situated beside the door to the storage room.
Pots and shallow pans, every utensil conceivable for a kitchen and a few
that aren't hang from the walls between ovens.  A large, deep sink is fixed
with a pressure-wash sprayer for quick cleaning.

`pThe Lory`g'`ps Nest`g - `pStorage Room`n~
A white string hangs from the naked bulb on the ceiling, pouring down
light enough to see clearly when the string is tugged to turn the fixture on
or off.  Dozens of unopened and partially emptied cardboard boxes are
stacked in the storage room, all of them containing plastic-wrapped books
from varying authors in varying genres.  The boxes form several towers that
reach to the ceiling.  There is little room to breathe and less room to
walk; one must know precisely what they're looking for or spend hours - if
not days - trying to sort it out of storage.  The topmost boxes on most of
the stacks contain seasonal decorations; red and green paper chains for
Christmas, silk leaves in autumnal colours and wreaths of wicker for fall,
plastic eggs and window decals of bunnies for spring and a couple odd
statuettes of animals surfing for summer.  Most of the decorations still
have their store tags attached to them, suggesting they have never seen use.
There is a musty, bookish odor in the storage room, and the floor is
unfinished wood planked loosely over the foundation.

A Bedroom~
Simplicity is the key element to this room, its stark white walls
disrupted only by a dark cherry wood wardrobe and the simple single-person
bed lining the opposite wall.  The bedspread is a deep burgundy color and is
void of any embroidery or decorative pillows.  Light is fed through the room
by a small window.  The curtains have been precisely pinned back to reveal
the decorative landscaping of the house's southern grounds.  Two doors lead
in and out of the room, one leading to the hallway, while the second smaller
door leads to the kitchens.

A Guest Room~
Entering from the north, the guest bedroom provides an intimate sleeping
area for anyone that is a guest of the estate.  A small wooden table with a
white lace cloth displays various personal items, among them are a vial of
perfume and a small silver brush.  Across the room is a four-post bed with a
white sheer canopy draping about the sides.  Upon the bed is a white spread,
and several oversized goose feather pillows.  On the eastern wall is a
bookshelf filled with books on topics of local interest.  Pushed against the
far wall, a personal sized desk and chair are illuminated by a tiny oil
lamp.  When lit it gives the subtly warm radiance that seems to never reach
the corners of the room.

#bAbandoned Cathedral of Saint Sophia#n~
Cobwebs so dense they nearly obscure passage through the half-rotted
boards that were once intended to keep the wide double doors shut, have been
woven tightly across the entirety of the doorframe.  Old, creaky pews still
standing by sheer will alone line the sides of the broken cathedral, and at
the center is a walkway perhaps four feet wide, that leads up to the raised
dais upon which chipped stone pedastals holding statues of the Virgin Mary
and Christ stand on opposite sides of an altar, the filthy, moth-eaten and
time-worn white runner making apparant what the time of year was when the
church was abandoned.  Draping from the once high, beautifully painted
vaulted ceilings are thick tendrils of cobwebs, and the intricate stained
glass windows depicting Biblical scenes have long been shattered; the little
shards of colored glass now lie in unceremonious piles at the floor beneath
where they once stood.  At the very front of the Cathedral, the only item
lacking in the thick dust that lies heavy upon all other areas, is a massive
cross with a marble, gruesome depiction of the crucified savior, with stone
droplets of blood dripping down his hallowed brow.

This large and expansive room is truly easily noticed to be the master
bedroom of the estate.  Two twin oil lamps cast a soft glow about the room
allowing the corners to remain deep within the shadows.  A massive four post
bed rests in the center of the room.  Deep amethyst drapes and bed linens
seem to be the only color of the room besides that of the red oak from which
the bed and private desk are made.  The heavy drapes upon the windows in the
room and hanging from the canopy of the bed, block out all the light from
the outside world.  The fragrance of fresh flowers gently drifts through the
air

This is a shoddy living quarters.  Wind whips through the cracks in the
crumbling walls.  The poorly made door more or less sits against the
opening, sitting only on one hinge.  Mice scatter across the dirt floor,
squeaking playfully.  Two small cots sit on opposite sides of the room.  A
small brick fireplace, roughly build, warms the room with small flames.  A
barrel of water at the foot of one bed and a wash tub leaning against the
wall.

`eNew Orleans Airport `n(`eAvg`n.`e NPCs`n:`e 300`n)~
Even when full of people, this massive place bears a feel of vacancy. 
From the high ceilings to thin and cheap slate grey carpeting, spinning
baggage claims and Cinnabon or coffee kiosks surrounded by chairs and a few
unmoving, tiny tables, an emptiness is everpresent.  The initial space is
gigantic, marked on either side by the professional, red and blue
illuminated signs to summon patrons to check bags and get boarding passes
from their specific airline.  Security checks can be seen before a large
pair of escalators, one going up, the other down, with metal-detectors and a
machine with bins to empty the contents of your pockets, place any bags
into, and place your shoes for weapons or explosives checks.  At the top of
the escalators one can get the last goodbye wave from a loved one, before
they disappear into the main stretch of the airport with the rest of the
passengers.

A large oak door lies to the south closed tight until another patient
enters the hospital's walls.  The ceiling is high, the walls mostly bare and
the floor lined with plain white tiles easy to clean.  A few nursemaids walk
back and forth patrolling the hospital willing to answer questions and
direct the injured to the rooms in the back to wait for their treatment. 
North lies the waiting area and south leads back outside into the usually
peaceful courtyard.

A few chairs have been pushed against the western wall as well as an old
plush couch that was donated to this establishment here for those who wish
to wait on the health of a comrade or family member.  To the east lies a
small chapel for any who would wish to pray, south lies the way out and
north are the rooms in which the patients are brought to.  A small cross
lies on the wall above a simple desk hung above the makeshift nurses station
as a sign of hope for all who enter this place.  The rest of the walls have
a few bits of donated #bartwork#n but nothing extravagant, just something to
keep the mind busy as the time passes.

The western wall sports two paintings hung next to one another.  The
pieces seem to give those within this room hope or simply something to pass
the time around as they focus on the minute details or the colors of the
swirling paint.
 
Painting One: A gorgeous blue sea stretches out to the
horizon.  The painting seems to be of a boat sailing at night.  The stars
overhead are so numerous it is a wonder the artist was able to paint so
many.  The ship appears to be a large shipping vessel with tiny figures
srambling all over it in the dark.  A small lamp has been painted on near
the rudder showing a man studying a map.
 
Painting Two: An island stands
alone in a vast sea in this painting.  A large mountain looms in the center
of the island, covered with trees.  A reef clearly surrounds the island as
waves with white tops seem to break upon it.  The surf looks so real and
it's almost like the ocean itself can be heard.  Light colored sandy beaches
surround the island and it appears uninhabited.

and peaceful serenity to an otherwise hectic city.

The wide open living space is lit from above by an open skylight pouring
through the exposed beams of a cathedral ceiling; the sky window forms a
dome with a stained glass orchid at the highest point, filtering the light
through to project a diluted image of the purple flower on the dark hardwood
floor.  The living area is outlined by an l-shaped, plush canary yellow sofa
with white throw pillows stacked neatly into the corners.  A hand-quilted
patchwork blanket is folded over the arm.  The wall that acts as one side of
the living space's frame is painted cream white, and a large, flat,
frameless television screen is mounted against it.  The coffee table is a
wood dark enough to match the flooring, and situated at its middle is a
glass bowl filled with fragrant freesia potporri and clear green marbles. 
Artfully placed black frames contain photographs of rural Louisiana and the
deep bayou, many depicting old-growth willow and cypress trees coated with
sheets of pale green Spanish moss, but just as many showing simple shots of
colorful birds on half-submerged logs or green ponds of water.  There is a
panoramic cityscape of the French Quarter by night above the wide bay window
that offers a serene view of the marina.  The rustic-fitted kitchen lies
around a corner but is left visible to the living area through the opening
above the redwood breakfast bar.  A wide hallway with a bright window at the
end leads deeper into the condo.

cots that may be needed to fill the patients rooms south from here.  It
looks to be very organized and nothing is out of place as of yet, the
supplies are well stocked for now.  The floor is bare wood lined with a thin
sheet of fabric in some places to catch any spills from the alcohol or water
stored here and otherwise the floor and ceiling is empty, merely the racks
on the sides of the wall are full.

#wA Secret Corridor#n~
Set beneath the large supply room is this mini corner of the hospital for
the more secretive and more serious cases.  Set to the south is a padded
cell for any unruly or crazed patients that might find their way into this
hospital and that room is set up for any serious surgery that may have to
take place.  Other than the room south this place is relatively empty and is
only lit with a few candles pasted to the wall.  The floors are a bare wood
and the walls are plain white and unadorned.

#wA Padded Cell#n~
Each of the walls have been padded by pillows full of straw and feathers
that have bascially been nailed to the wall as high as the ceiling.  The
floor is relativly bare except for a few metal hoops that have been bolted
to the thick wood.  In the center of the room lies a long table of sorts
that is more of a bed than a real table.  On each side of the table,
restraints have been placed made of a thick metal for those unruly patients
or those who have lost their minds.  A small desk with two drawers lies near
the table and its drawers are full of various surgical utensils that can
very well be described as unusual and possibly torture-like types.  There is
no window of course in this room for it lies below ground and beyond that
the room is relativly clean and simple.

#pFrais Minois Ballroom#n~
A huge expanse spacious enough to be a full a ballroom spans past the
huge, thick cherry stained double-doors that mark the entrance of the
building.  Wall to wall carpeting of a thick cream color that causes any
footfalls to sink in at least an inch lines the whole of the floor, all the
way up to the door that leads west, and the pair of single-paned french
doors that open to a balcony in the murky darkness.  A collection of dark
mahogany tables have been arranged throughout a section of the space; a pair
of fat, dark vermillion sofas are arranged facing one another, perhaps seven
feet between them, and a pair of rather comfortable looking cream-white
cushioned chairs stand opposite each other, one on either end of the
couches, closing off an ample, public sitting area.  Sat at a forty-five
degree angle from the piano is a medieval fainting chair of rich, red
velvet, and on the ceiling directly above is a perfectly round stained glass
window.  The rest of the wallspace is completely occupied by works of art of
all styles and genres that span from floor to vaulted ceiling in diagonals
and verticles.  A building model covered with a silken sheet of red sits
upon one of the tables, near the center.  Classical music of a soft,
melodical sort drifts from a live orchestra buried into a pit in the
farthest corner possible, filling the ballroom with flowing sound enough for
several dozen couples to dance near the center of the room.

#wThe Doctor's Private Chambers#n~
This room is practically just a hole in the ground but it is plenty
enough for the doctor of the hospital.  A small oak desk is pushed in the
corner of the room and parchment, quill and ink lie atop it.  But a few
steps past the desk is a small bed holding few luxeries save for a straw
matress, pillow and blanket.  A small bookshelf lies next to the desk and
holds more hand written notes than real books and has plenty of room to
place more items.  The only light in the room is from a small lantern on the
desk and from a few randomly placed candles.  A simple trunk lies at the
foot of the bed to store personal goods and clothing and is the last piece
of furniture in the room.

#gCourtyard of the fortress#n~
Behind large wooden gates and a heavy iron porcullis lies the courtyard
of this fortress.  Once used as a fortification for the Moorish leaders of
the Cordoba Caliphate this fortress fell to Christian armies and is now
occupied by the Castillian lord of Cordoba.  On either sides of the gate are
turrets occupied by guards at all times.  This courtyard area is huge, with
orange trees lining the walkway up to the entrance of the fortress and to
the guard barracks on the far eastern side of the courtyard.  A large
fountain stands in the middle of this green area, providing water for the
fortresses inhabitants and animals, most of whom are housed in the stables
near the barracks.

#wA Modest Courtyard#n~
A pebbled path not yet worn from use leads to the west to what can only
be described as a small shack.  Directly north is the charity hospital of
cordoba and to the east heads back to the streets of the city.  Around the
area are a few benches set up for any who wish to wait outside and enjoy the
gifts of nature and the peace and quiet that usually resides here.  A few
small trees have been freshly planted here and have not yet taken root, but
other than that the courtyard is empty.

This shack is a sort of place to store carriages or horses for those
wealthy enough to have such a luxery.  A few servants are here to give the
basic necessities to the horses, watering them and offering a bit of hay or
oats depending on the season.  Anything else wanted by the owners of the
animals must be paid for in advance, after all there is so much charity a
hospital can be ran off of.

#cBefore the guard barracks#n~
The guard barracks loom before you.  Although used for military purposes,
the unique architecture style of the barracks makes it seem more like a
mini-palace and an offshoot of the fortress than a utilitarian structure
built for housing troops.  Against the south wall of the sprawling fortress
complex is the low-lying thathed building that comprises the stables. 
Although the bulk of the animals housed there are horses, both fine arabians
and the massive warhorses so popular elsewhere in Europe, there are also
dozens of cows, chickens and pigs.  Most of these domestic animals are kept
in the stables until they are slaughtered for food, so that they do not
become a meal for the dogs that roam about the fortress.

#cThe fortress barracks#n~
This entrance room to the guard barracks is a large hall with a stone
floor.  A cross hangs above the doorway and three tapestries hang on the
walls, depicting various Catholic saints.  The heavy, reinforced wooden
doors that lead to and from the barracks can be locked by use of a large
crossbar that lies against the wall, ready to be swung into place should the
fortress ever come under attack.  A stone staircase leads up from here to
the towers and dormitories of the barracks.  Doors open to the north, south
and east.

Sitio detras de la tienda de Lecuox~
Several wooden crates have been stacked along the north and west walls of
this room.  Most are marked in clearly in a variety of tongues, "Fragile". 
The boxes are stacked high to the ceiling to allow a great deal of space in
the center of the room.  A beautifully crafted couch sits along the southern
wall, shipped here all the way from Paris.  A woven carpet covers much of
the floor.  Its intricate patterns seem to weave and crossover each other in
an endless loop.  A beautiful mahogany armoire stands just to the left of
the couch.  On the east wall near the back of the room is a tub for bathing.
It looks possibly large enough for two people.  A small fireplace, set into
the east wall keeps the room warm, even on the coldest of nights.  In the
center of the room stands a wooden easel.  A blank canvas sits upon it
waiting for whoever should feel compelled to fill it.  Brushes and small
stone containers of pigments sit nearby on a small stool, used as a table.

This hall is quite long, though the ceiling is not very high in

head level.  This dormitory is where a number of servants and squires are
housed.  Rows upon rows of beds are lined up against the walls, at the foot
of each bed a small chest for personal belongings.  Two fireplaces are also
installed in this hall to heat it during the winters.

Sitio ocultado debajo de la tienda de Lecuox~
A narrow flight of stairs leads to the trapdoor in the room above under
the rug.  Built into the floor so that even upon close inspection it would
be difficult to find.  The room itself is quite nicely setup.  A fireplace
burns brightly in the east wall its chimney masked by the fireplace set
directly on top of it in the room above.  A single stone step leads into an
alcove on the west side of the room where a large full-size bed sits, with a
thickly stuffed mattress and many blankets.  A small table with three chairs
sits to one side of the room offering a place to sit and talk.  A dressing
table rests against the wall on the other side of the room with a tall
wardrobe beside it for clothing.  A painting hangs on the wall of a
beautiful young woman.  She is dressed in royal attire and wears a small
crown on her head.  She appears to be blushing in the picture and holds one
hand to her mouth to hide a giggle.  Near the bottom of the painting on the
right are the initials "L.  R."  .

#cA barracks armory#n~
This armory is about the size of a peasant's house, though contains no
windows, fireplace, or anything else domestic.  Instead all that is here are
weapons and knight's armor.  The doors are always kept tightly locked, for
fear of theft.  The weapons and armor here is all quite large, those piece
of equipment that are too big to go anywhere else.  Suits of metal armor,
spears, javelins, heavy crossbows and large swords all lean against the wall
or are set up on wooden shelves or, in the case of the armor, hung upon
dummies.

-Front yard-~
A small grove of weeping willows clot closely together around several
small fallen pilasters flanking a trodden dirt path that winds its way
through a mass of willows.  Their stoic boughs brush the ground creating a
soft haunting song of earth as the faint wind whispers through them. 
Protected by their vigilance a weather worn wooden door can be seen just
peaking through the dense foliage.  Three layered pieces of stone rest one
on top of the next serving as steps up to the aged door that serves as
portal to a house that seems to have become part of the lands surrounding
it.  The grass is lush and green, far more vibrant at the base of the trees
than anywhere else along the trail.  The trodden path curves further along
past the house to lead one to an archway of woven sticks, with a white
washed gate slightly set ajar, through which one can make out and over grown
tangle of fruit trees and a roofed well.  The wild growth shows little to no
tending, though very few fruits seem to have fallen to the ground, and a
ladder and baskets are scattered around below.  The deciduous trees toward
the back of the tangled orchard giving way to heavy clusters of rich full
weeping giving cover to a small, but clean chicken coop.  A small but neat
garden is tucked just behind the house, slightly in need of weeding.

This stone room is quite small, and circular.  With no windows and only
enough room for three people comfortably, it is not a main area of the
fortress.  Stone steps lead down into the dungeons beneath the fortress.  A
burning torch hangs on the wall throwing off some light.

-A common room-~
A comfortable yet well-worn couch the color of the forest pine needles,
stands alone atop a woven rug making a nice place to be seated and chat.  In
the corner of the room are two cushioned wooden chairs around a small square
table with a painted checkered design upon it.  Simple wooden figures of
different heights and design are scattered across the squares, with one of
the taller crowned ones on its side in defeat.  A few bright green plants
sit on wooden stands near a large window with drab gray drapes tied open on
both sides.  The wooden planks are bowed below the window, where water
damage is evident.  The glass rectangles that make up the window is very old
and the impurities have settled near the bottom, giving the bottom inch on
each glass plate a smoky look.  Sharing the other half of the room is the
kitchen area .  A well-used baking block stands in the center of the floor
just before the fireplace, still covered with a bit of flour.  The fireplace
itself is made of water polished river rock with a field stone hearth, a
long beam of carved wood makes up the mantle.  A large cooking kettle hangs
on a swivel, just inside the lip of the fireplace, beside a cut out nook
made for storing away a few nights worth of kindling and firewood.  A small
pantry stands slightly ajar next to a large hutch that displays several
earthenware jars, and other household goods.  Tucked into the far corner, is
a large bathing tub with a stack of neatly folded drying cloths and a lump
of soap nestled in beside it.  Standing in a corner, not far from the fire
is an abused dining table, with three simple yet finely crafted chairs.  A
rickety stairway, much in need of repair leads to the next floor.

#cThe fortress dungeons#n~
Beneath the fortress lie these dungeons.  Dank and cold, with a lingering
smell of must and human excrement, these dungeons are far from the airy
openness of the above ground fortress.  Torches line the walls throwing off
the only light in this windowless purgatory.  It is here that the overflow
of criminals stay when the Calahorra Fort's prisons are full, or simply
where those especially important or dangerous political or religious
criminals stay to await trial or, more likely, execution.

-Stairs and Hallway-~
A simple banister of oak is topped with a small aloe plant badly in need
of water.  The well worn stairs are covered with a slightly thread bare
woven runner of deep burgundy.  Having walked up the stairs one would note
both the sixth and twelfth step creek faintly as if perhaps a nail is loose.
A burgundy rug lays sprawled in over a warm brown oaken floor, a small table
resting in the center of it.  Upon the table is seated a small copper urn
filled to the rim with bright white flowers, a simple oil lamp perched next
to it.  Two stout dark wood doors flank the hallway, making up the full
upper floor.  A single window rests across from the staircase, banked by
shallow shelves on both sides, a window seat underneath.

-Master Bedroom-~
Entering from the hallway through the door one is greeted by a rather
simple room, a few small homemade rugs spread over the smooth wooden floor. 
Low eaves lay bare overhead showing an aged wood, though a small portion of
it is divided from the rest forming a sort of loft, a ladder the only access
to it.  A single window is over the bed allowing the light to filter in
through the dusty glass.  A double bed covered in a lofty quilt of green
wool, the color standing out like a stain in the room.  A simple but
comfortable chair is perched just inside the door, a faded green in color
with a small worn wooden table beside it, holding an oil lamp.  A carved
wooden chest rests at the foot of the bed, a green woven blanket tossed over
the top.  The wall across from the door has a small fireplace of common
field stone, flanked on the right by a large hand painted depiction of an
open window, showing eternal spring, though the paint is faded and chipped
away.  A few simple trinkets and bobbles decorate the top of the mantle, the
largest of them being a circle of woven willow branches.

-A Bedroom-~
A simply furnished room lies behind a creaky door.  A bed filled with
down feathers lay in the corner of the room with a large, warm, woolen
blanket, a dark blue color draped upon it.  The ends of the blanket lightly
sweep on the wooden planks of the floor.  A trunk is at the foot of the bed,
aesthetic in design, but practical in use.  When the room is in use, a small
fire heats up the area in a stone fireplace, which looks like a few stones
make need to be replaced.  A mantle is above the fireplace with small
trinkets from lands afar and some candles burned down to the nubs.  A sturdy
wooden writing desk lies near the window, where the curtain seems to often
be opened, letting the sun or moonlight spill into the room and upon a few
ceramic pots containing a few herbs.  Two cozy chairs sit not too far from
the fire, a small table between them with a small crocheted doily upon it. 
A few framed paintings are upon the walls depicting calming natural scenes. 
A few woven rugs are aesthetically placed about; giving the room a more
lived in feel.

-A Personal Library-~
A small skeleton key sits in the keyhole of the door that leads to the
library, but rarely is it ever locked.  Shallow shelves line almost every
part of the walls and hold a myriad of leather-bound books in a few
languages.  The shelves are slightly bowed under the weight of the writings
of history, poetry and personal works, not to mention a few small statues
and worldly trinkets.  A few books are stacked upon the floor, unable to be
places upon the shelves.  In the corner of the room is a structure similar
to a wine rack in making, but holds hundreds of scrolls; older yellowed ones
are higher up as they are most fragile.  In the middle of the room is a dark
green rug, with splatters upon it where ink was spilled and stained.  On top
of the rug is a desk whose appearance is scratched and well worn, the finish
worn away in a few spots and the top right-hand corner is stained black. 
Candles upon brass candleholders are over run with melted wax, sealing them
to the wood.  A small practical fireplace warms the room and keeps dampness
from destroying the books, a metal screen before it to protect from fire.  A
comfortable leather chair sits before the fire, the leather splitting at the
corners the chair from intense cold and lack of care.  There is one small
window in the room, but is always closed and has fabric on the ground before
it to catch any water that would seep in and potentially ruin any carelessly
placed books.

#cDining hall of the barracks#n~
This long room has a vaulted ceiling and is kept warm by a massive
fireplace on one side of the hall.  There is a long wooden table in this
area with enough chairs to seat dozens of soldiers at a time.  It is here
where the knights of Castile chosen to defend this city take their meals.

The Dakka~
This place is only for the Muezzin to give his prayers to those within
the Masjid.  He shall be seated at the Kursai and have the Koran in front of
him and no others shall enter this sacred place.  Two small stairs leads up
to the seated place of the Muezzin and back down brings him back to the
common area for the masses.

Placed in a corner are a few small portions of body parts from known
religious personalities.  Also some of their personal items are kept in
these reliquaries.  A small stone staircase heads upwards to the Minaret and
is only used by the Muezzin to usher his prayers to the city before going to
the Dakka holding the prayers before the populas in the Masjid.

a window that looks down upon the courtyard below.  Swords, arrows, daggers,
bows, crossbows and spears are contained in this room in large amounts,
stacked on top of each other and anywhere they can be fit.  These weapons
are constantly being sharpened and taken care of by the soldiers and squires
so that are are ready for use should the need ever arise.

This is where the meals are cooked for the knights staying at the barracks. 
With so many mouths to feed these kitchens are staffed just about around the
clock, constantly preparing food for someone.  Some of the lower servants
not lucky enough to sleep in dormitories also make their beds here near the
warm stoves at night.

the hearth and the fireplace where there is a small enough fire with a
kettle.  Off to the side is a small area to which one could conceivably cut
food, a table is positioned in the middle of the room as of to the northeast
seems to be a door to another room.

is of to the east side of the room.  A nice rug seems to cover a good deal
of the floor.

Torturing Room~
It seems that this is the nerve center for all of this persons work, what
ever that might be.  The floor has drains at a few intervals for what
purpose is unknown until the room is really looked at, torches can be seen
at intervals to give enough light for whatever is done down here.  There are
three tables in the room, one can be identified as an examination type
table, with iron restraints.  The second smaller table next to it has many
implements on it and the third seems to be a stretching sort of machine. 
There are four sets of shackles about the room one in peticular is between
to pillar-like structures.  There is a room to the west that seems
unoccupied at the moment.

Before the gates of Cordoba~
Looming up from the ground are the tall walls of the city of Cordoba. 
The city is so large that the walls wrap around so far they seem to
disappear into the horizon.  These are the large gates of the West Gate.  A
large metal portcullis spans the large gap in the walls and thick oak double
doors that stand over two stories high swing open into the city.  The gate
itself is wide enough for several carts to pass side by side.

entrance swamp/hive thing~
Put south of 10097 The Guadalquivir river has now slowed down forming a
large mass of thick squishy semi-ground.  The ground has now turned to swamp
lands and now and then taking the wrong step can mean certain death to any
not able to swim if they are lucky to avoid the quick sands.  One certainly
has to learn their way about these lands to protect themselves.  The swamp
continues on into the deeper regions and shows no sign of inhabitance by
much of anything or anyone.

Front Room~
Entering the living area of this simple home the senses are met with the
fragrant scent of burnt wood.  The source of this smell a fireplace that has
been built into a recess in the northwestern corner of the room.  A simple
yet decently made gray rug sits before the fireplace, covering half the
floor.  A simple dining table with four chairs sits off near the
southwestern wall, leaving room between it and a small cupboard.  The walls
are made of simple wooden boards nailed together.  The framed windows are
bare and unadorned, wooden shudders used to protect against the weather,
held closed by a wooden bar with a central pivot bolt when the need arises. 
The door itself is made of plain wood, reinforced by iron brackets to
prevent break in's.

This rather moderate sized bedroom is sparsely furnished, containing only
the things needed for the barest care for one person.  There is a rather
comfortable looking bed in this room, placed against the northern wall
beneath the open window.  In the corner near the bed there is a large
cabinet the doors closed.  Inside is held all the things he might need to
take a bath.  A large metal tub, crudely made and obviously used for bathing
rests inside the cabinet as well.  An armoire with a mirror on top of it
sits on the opposite side of the bed along the corner of the northwestern
wall.  The floor covered by a soft yet inexpensive rug covering the room
from wall to wall, which are themselves adorned with in the same fashion as
the other rooms.

place to prepare meals.  An ashwood cabinet sits here against the eastern
wall for the purpose of storage.  Food supplies, household goods, etc.  One
small window adorns the bare wooden wall by the stove for ventilation and
the floor is made of simple wooden planking.  The only exit through the

exquisite torment and pleasure alike.  Hemp ropes, silken like pieces of
cloth, chains and shackles just some of the more useful things lie on the

metal mounts for holding the feet.  The last one is small of width, but the

Several rocks jut up from the ground here, and among them comes bubbling
from the earth a small spring of fresh water.  The smaller trees and

its way through the woods to the east.

The forest creek empties here into this pond.  The woods stop a few yards
from the water's edge, making for a small beach leading up to the pond. 
Quite wide, this pond is a favorite watering hole for nearly all the
creatures of these woods.  All manner of fish and water fowl inhabit this
pond.  The calm surface of the water reflects the view of the woods
perfectly.

Quite suddenly the forest stops, and a clearing appears.  The dense
treeline stands around this large vaguely circular area like dark sentinals.
Several large rocks and fallen logs are about this area, and the tall grass
and wild flowers of all colors flourish in this oasis of sunlight within the
dimly lit forest.

Here the forest slopes down drastically to meet the banks of the mighty
Guadalquivir river.  This river runs from farther north in Castile, all the
way through Cordoba, then on to Seville, and finally empties out into the
Atlantic Ocean.  A fish breaks the moving water of the surface as it leaps
through the air, tempting a nearby bird of prey.  The banks are mostly dirt
and sand, and regularly flood during the rainy season.

#gBank of the Guadalquivir River#n~
Here the forest slopes down drastically to meet the banks of the mighty
Guadalquivir river.  This river runs from farther north in Castile, all the
way through Cordoba, then on to Seville, and finally empties out into the
Atlantic Ocean.  A fish breaks the moving water of the surface as it leaps
through the air, tempting a nearby bird of prey.  The banks are mostly dirt
and sand, and regularly flood during the rainy season.

#bBook Shop - Main#n~
The walls are lined with thick old oak shelves, filled near to the brim
with old texts, primarily religious and biblical reference materials, more
containing Academic lore, Mathematics, History of various sorts.  The floor
is rather dusty, a large rug adoring most of the floor itself before coming
to the countertop also topped with many books pilled up, only a small part
cleared where vials of ink can be seen, and a few feather tip pens.  Behind
the counter is a single door with a large padlock upon it.

The room is dimly lit by a few oil lanterns on the walls of this room. 
There are four nicely crafted arm chairs, very soft and comfortable looking
surrounding a small table with a candelabra upon it, as well as a crystal
pitcher and a few empty crystal goblets.  On the southern wall is another
large bookcase filled with more books of many subjects and titles ranging in
many languages, some with no titles at all.  There are three doors from
here.

Very large bedroom of sorts comes before you as the door is open.  Void
of any windows as all the room sin this place, there lies four large beds. 
At the foot of every bed there is a large lockable chest.  Each bed is
adorned with fine white sheets and thick warm covers for those cold nights. 
The room is lit by a large hanging chandelier with twelve candles atop of it
half of them lit.  There is a single dresser with a mirror on the wall above
it, atop the dresser is a bowl with warm water and a few towels next to it.

The Master room is rather large with no windows.  In the center of the
room is a large double bed with very soft sheets and four large billowing
pillows at the head.  The frame is heavy oak, a canopy bed with draperies
along each side on all sides.  On the far wall is a large cabinet of sorts
where numerous pieces of clothing can be seen on shelves within. 
Surprisingly there is no real illumination in this room with no windows or
lanterns on the walls itself.

#rGatehouse#n~
The Gatehouse to the Villa of the Aemilianus Family seems to have worn
away.  The walls and the gatehouse seem to have been overtaken by ivy, yet
the black Iron Gate seems to be in well condition.  The inscription in Latin
above the gate, however, has worn away through the onslaught of the ages. 
Beyond the gates is a long path that extends upwards on a slight incline. 
Lining the path are lush trees, and beyond that a vineyard can be seen,
along with a wheat field.  The Villa itself sits atop the hill in the
distance, the white walls and red brick roof bring back a nostalgia of Roman
times, for whom knew them or a glimpse of nobility or the emerging merchant
class.

There is no vegetation here, yet for on the sides where terraces have been
built to hold flowers and small trees.  To the west is a wood building for
horses, and a few nays and whinnies can be heard.  To the north, there are a
few columns and an archway, with steps leading up to it.

which have horses in them, and hay covers the floor.  Along one wall are
various implements used to clean and take care of horses, along with
saddles, reigns, and bridles.  Also there are various blankets to cover the
horses for the colder winter nights.  At the very end of the stalls, there's
a small doorway, which is locked from the inside.

#rThe Atrium#n~
The Atrium of the Villa seems to give off a sense of Tranquility.  The
shape of the room is in a square, and all around is a walkway about 5 feet
wide.  The walkway is sheltered from the weather by a vaulted ceiling,
however the center of the Atrium is open to the sky.  On every side of the
Atrium are four columns, with a few steps leading into the center of the
atrium, between the second and third columns.  Along the sides of the center
of the Atrium are small terraces with flowers and bushes in them.  Smaller
pathways all converge on a center square where a fountain displays Janus in
an impressive pose, while the fountain itself is made out or rich white
marble.  The Atrium is lit, and heated by braziers.  There are two doorways,
to the north and west, while opened Archways lead to the east and the South.

#rGarden#n~
The gardens are very breath taking, besides being walled off on all
sides.  However, to the east a small stairway leads to a small landing where
one can overlook the lands that the Villa sits above.  The walls, except for
the stairway and the landing are covered in ivy, and flowers.  The garden
itself is very lush, with a few lemon and orange trees growing in the
corners, and small bushes and flowers growing all over.  A large pool is in
the center, used for swimming or bathing.  There are small stone pathways
through the garden, and a little off from the center is a sizable pond, with
fish swimming in it.  On one side of the pond, are a few trees that would
provide shade in the sun, and shadow during the night.  A few lanterns
hanging over the pathways, and other parts of the gardens.

#pU#embra #pS#epeculum~
To enter this bookstore you must first climb a set of old wooden stairs
along the outside of the brick building off pirate ally.  A heavy oak door
serves as the portal into the dank room, lit only by a few inadequate
overhead lamps.  Rows of bookshelves of various styles and fashion will most
of the room making it feel cramped and confined.  The books on the shelves
are all second hand and range in genre across all spectrum.  In the back
ofthe room is a counter that would look more at home in vintage bar.  Atop
the counter is an antique cash register that looks like it might just be
thefirst one to ever come to New Orleans.  A staircase can be seen go down
tothe room under bookstore.

The Servant Quarters are very generous for being the Quarters of the
Servants.  Small beds, each with its own draw curtain are mostly situated
against the Western Wall, while against the Southern is a very large
fireplace, with an iron grating over it.  A large basin for bathing is
tucked away in a corner of the room.  In the center of the room, are a few
large tables, with divans around them, enough to seat twenty or thirty
people.  There are small dressers next to each bed.

#pU#embra #pS#epeculum Storage Room~
The stairs lead down into a sparse brick room filled with stacks upon
stacks of boxes that can only be assumed to be filled with books.  In the
back of the room is a small oriental style room divider that blocks off what
looks to be a makeshift bedroom.  A simple cot covered in a mountain of
blankets and quits.  To the side is a simple chest of drawers with an cheap
lamp atop it.  Not much surprise that books are piled all around the bed. 
The walls of the room are covered in small windows that are permanently
bared.  One wall bares a steel security door that is most likely used for
delivered.  Across the room from it looks to be what was once a similar door
but the hole is now bricked up.

As with almost all the other rooms of the Villa, the Kitchen is large
indeed.  It has several fireplaces in which to cook and boil things, along
with a central fire pit.  Along one of the walls is a large brick oven. 
Many cutting and cooking utensils hang from small racks, and the smell of
freshly cooked meat still lingers in the air.  There is a small stairway
leading to a door that leads to the wine cellar.

The Dinning Room is fairly large, and seems it would be able to sit a
large amount of people.  The tables are low to the ground and set up in a
slight square, with an opening on one side.  Surrounding the tables are very
comfortable looking divans, draped in purples, oranges, reds and yellows. 
Upon the walls are various beautiful frescos.  Some of them depict Roman
families, while others depict battles.  The Dinning room is lit and heated
by various braziers.

No expense was cut short when creating the living room of the Villa. 
Many Divans lay scattered about the large room, and small fountains lay in a
square pattern around the Center of the living room.  However, at the center
is a small fire pit, which is used for heat, and braziers line the wall,
which provide the lighting.  On the floor is a large Fresco of fish jumping
in a river, and on one wall is a fresco of Scipio Africanus leading an army
against Cartage.  Over the windows are purple drapes, and on the various
tables are silver platters laden with figs, olives, oranges, lemons, and
grapes.

#rA Small Garden#n~
The small garden provides a nice little relaxation spot after or before
dinner, or when one simply does not want to stay indoors.  Small trees,
which surround the garden, provide shade, and there are benches mostly
around a center square, where wide basin fountain is.  The ground is also
stone, except for small planters filled with flowers and bushes.  Strangely
enough, the Garden is mostly enclosed and a small openings in the ceiling
allow light to filter in.  Several braziers are along the wall, which light
the Small Garden.  There is a Stairwell that leads upwards, the sides
covered in ivy.  Terraces also seem to hang from the high ceiling.

terraces which contain plants are hanging from the ceiling, which are filled
with bushes, hanging ivy, and flowers.  Also, there is a small walkway,
going around half of the garden and small fountains trickle down from near
the ceiling into lower basins.  On the ground is a fresco of a few fish,
swimming along a stream.  To the south is a pair of large double doors, and
to the east.

No lavishness was spared when creating the Guest Quarters of the Villa. 
The large double doors open to a pair of heavy thick curtains, which conceal
the Quarters.  Behind the curtains it can be seen that the Guest Quarter is
very large and that the ceiling vaults upwards.  In the middle of the
Southern Wall is a large four poster bed, with ivory silk curtains that
drape down.  To the west is a large fireplace covered with an iron grating. 
The floors are covered in fine Persian rugs, while a large desk is to the
east.  A few divans sit around the center of the room, where a table is.  On
the table is a silver platter filled with grapes, figs, olives, oranges, and
lemons.  Also a few goblets and a pitcher of wine sit on the table.

The Library of the Villa is gargantuan to say the least.  Rows upon rows
of bookshelves are filled across the room.  Books line the walls, as well as
scrolls, and even a few tables are over laden with them.  Books of all kinds
can be found here, including maps of Spain, Greece, Italy, France, Germany,
Britain, parts of Eastern Europe, the Middle East and North Africa. 
Genealogies of Kings and Emperors can be found, as well as many historical
texts of Empires and Kingdoms.  The floor is covered in a fine Persian
carpet, and to the South is a large window which overlooks the Villa's'
Atrium.  Small braziers are placed around the room, which light and heat it.
The room vaults upwards into a domed ceiling.

The Quarters of Demodocus are decadent, and lavish to say the least. 
Thick purple and red drapes cover the windows that are all over the room, as
well as thick shutters.  The room itself is very large and to the eastern
wall is a large four poster bed, with ivory opaque silk drapes.  The bed
itself is lined with pillows and sheets, although they seem a little
undisturbed as if he slept on top of the blankets and didn't bother getting
underneath them.  Dominating the center of the room is an enormous desk that
is covered with texts, parchments, maps, genealogies of mortals and
Cainites, scroll and several tomes and books.  The floors are covered with
Persian rugs, and a large fireplace dominates the northern wall covered by
an iron grating.  Over to one side of the room is a simple iron staircase
leading upwards.

The Observatory of the Villa is splendid.  Part of it is in closed by a
sizable copula, while a 5-foot walkway surrounds it.  Inside the copula is a
desk with various star charts sitting upon it along with various books and
scrolls.  In small planters situated around the desk are various plants,
many tall and lush looking to be well taken care of.  A set of gardening
tools lie on a small desk behind the larger one.  From the copula and the
walkway, a three hundred sixty-degree panoramic view of the country side can
be seen.

Cellar.  There are various rows of wine racks, most of them well stocked
with red and white wines.  Along the walls are small open torches to provide
lighting for the cellar if need be, and along one wall Is a faded fresco of
a Roman get together, people laying down on divans drinking and eating,
musicians and a few people dancing.

#pGate to a Monastery#n~
Ivy seems to cover the short stone walls surrounding the yard.  The walls
themselves are made of many small stones stacked upon each other in such a
way as to negate the use of mortar.  A wooden gate hangs from one side of
the wall, mainly used to keep animals in.  The yard itself is divided into
several small areas with roughly built stick fences seperating them.  A few
moderately sized buildings sit in various places around the large yard
serving various different functions.  However it is the building which sits
directly in the center of the yard which the monks here hold in the highest
regard.  With its towering bell tower, stone walls, and small but, none the
less beautiful stained glass windows stands the Monastery itself.

The small dirt road leading north from Seville to the ancient Roman ruins
of Italica ends here.  Just up ahead the outlines of some low-lying
swellings left over from hundreds of years prior can be seen.  Some large
chucks of stone sit in the plain that Italica is situated in, and the
treelines of the hills thin slightly as the wood moves closer into the small
valley of ruins.

stone buildings that once served as the residences and places of business
for its Roman inhabitants.  Long since abandonded and believed to be
haunted, the only visitors these ruins have are the insects and animals that
now live here.  A trail is noticeable going through the ruins, heading east
and west through Italica.

The buildings are still few and far between in this section of the
ancient city.  Most of the ruins are small and overgrown with plantlife.  A
certain chill hangs in the air, and when combined with the eerie quiet it is
quite easy to see why not a single soul strays into the ruins.  Farther on
down this way the trail becomes an actual paved road and heads deeper into
the ruins.

the hundreds and hundreds of years they have been in use.  The buildings,
though still dilapidated, grow more numerous here, some of them even
retaining all of their walls, even fewer with a partial roof.  East is the
way out of the ruins, and north heads up further into Italica.

open sky seeing as the roof is completely missing.  One wall, the northern
wall, still bears a massive mosaic artwork, colorful and vivid even after
all these hundreds of years, it depicts a floral scene.

#GTulane University#n - #wWall Residential College#n~
Matte brown tiles pave the floor of the Residential College's foyer, the
walls themselves painted a pale soothing salmon pink.  A round wooden
counter near to the left just before a large entrance way into the rest of
the building can be seen, a pile of brochures and flyers stacked on top of
the counter.  A small ceramic pot of fake sunflowers decorates one end of
the counter while a couple of black record files are placed neatly between
bookends.  The guest register is left open on the top of the counter with an
attached pen on it; a small security telephone is placed next to the
register itself, with instructions on how to call the residents staying in
the dormitory.  A comfortable setting of wooden couches with rough brown
cotton cushions are placed to the right, surrounding a low table piled with
some magazines.  A large TV sits on the cabinet near to the furniture, the
remote for it placed by the side.  The glass doors are automatically locked
and can only be accessed through a key-card.  Near to the doors leading into
the building, two payphones of black plastic is placed on a wooden ledge
with tall bar stools placed under it.  Adjacent to the payphones are two
vending machines -- one with a selection of soda and hot drinks, the other
with snacks, candy and chocolate.  A flight of stairs inwards leads up to
the rest of the floors of the dormitory complex.  Resident rules and other
important notices are posted up on the glass-covered board just before the
stairs.

#GTulane University#n - #wDormitory Corridor#n~
The flight of cement stairs ends on a square landing attached to a long
corridor flanked with two pale blue painted walls.  Dark brown wooden doors
line the entire length of the corridor, some opened and others closed to
secure privacy.  Student activity sometimes goes on till late hours in the
night.  Shoe racks and other belongings are at times, placed outside the
doors and more than often, welcome mats and little personalization fixtures
can be found outside some of the doors.  At the north end of the corridor is
a small kitchenette for the use of the residents of the college.  Facing the
kitchenette is a closed cream-painted door to the female washroom while the
male washroom is down the other end.  Next to the kitchenette, an opening to
a flight of stairs can be seen, with deep red railings, heading upwards to
the second floor of the residential college.

Spartan white tiles play over the small kitchenette's floor, the
perimeter of the room lined with soft yellow cabinets both on the ground and
overhead.  An old stove with an broiler and grill sits in a corner facing a
large metal refrigerator used for the common storage of the residents' food
products.  A wooden table with a clean plastic covering seats around four
people comfortably enough.  A broom and dustpan, together with a mop and
attached bucket can be found behind the door of the kitchenette.  Terry
towels dry on a metal rack on one of the walls while the only window in the
room looks out to the grassy knolls and old cypresses of the university
campus.

`oPatisserie Berjouhi Bakery`n~
Welcome to Patisserie Berjouhi!  Here, only the finest ingredients are
used to create delectable Armenian pastries.  Display cases show off freshly
baked treats and behind the counter is the surprisingly small kitchen where
the pastries are made.  Patrons are welcomed to sit and relax while enjoying
their desert and authentic Armenian coffee (Surj).  If one was so inclined,
he or she, after drinking the coffee, could flip the cup over and allow the
residue to create patterns.  From there the patterns or pakhd, would be read
and a fortune told by a local Armenian fortune teller for a small fee.  The
environment is comfortable and boasts many pieces of Armenian artwork,
furniture and rugs.  Luxurious sofas, plush chairs and hand crafted wooden
tables sit on beautiful hand woven rugs, and promote more of a family
environment than a sterilized setting so common in many American bakeries. 
The walls are painted a warm garnet, and under the rugs, light wooden floors
creak and welcome visitors to the patisserie.  Recessed lighting creates a
comfortable ambiance that many customers take advantage of by staying to
read, write or just hang out with friends.  Though Armenian music is piped
through the entire store, it plays so softly that it is almost hard to hear
when there is more than one conversation going on.  Once a week, usually on
Fridays, several musicians come and play traditional Armenian folk music and
impromptu melodies, live for the entertainment of patrons.  Dancing and of
course singing are encouraged.  The menu at this patisserie boasts date,
pistachio and walnut mammoul and mammoul madd, assorted cookies and
marzipan, delectable kataifi deserts, and several different baklava.  The
only beverage offered is traditional Armenian coffee.  To the west, a door,
leading up to Xuxas apartment above, is marked private and sits to the left
of the display cases and counter.

`oLiving Area`n~
After walking through the door from the bakery, the warm and cozy feeling
continues into Xuxas home.  Rich golds and warm reds predominate the living
area.  Hanging on the windows are sheer crimson draperies flecked with gold,
two Armenian wall hangings flank each side of the large window.  The living
area is large, classically decorated, and comfortable.  Crimson sofas with
classic Armenian designs and thick corded fringe along the bottom, are posed
so they are easy to get around, but offer a comfortable sitting area
conducive to conversation.  On one side of a couch, a matching dog bed sits,
obviously well used and very comfortable for Xuxas constant canine
companion.  On the left wall, an ornate armoire sits, when opened a Murphy
bed unfolds, offering a soft warm place for Xuxas assistant to sleep at
night when there are guests in the house.  To the right of the armoire is a
small kitchen which is always clean though it is used frequently.  To the
south is the guest room, and to the west is the master bedroom.

`oMaster Bedroom`n~
A change in decor offers the ambiance of both Armenia and the charm of
New Orleans.  Several old roof tiles, that have artist renditions of New
Orleans affixed to them, hang on one wall that also holds the closet, while
hanging over the bed, three hand painted Armenian art contrast with the
tiles, though they do not clash.  Plush rugs cover the hard wood floors.  A
luxurious and very large bed stands against the north wall and is covered in
plain, classical linens as not to detract from the art.  On the right side
of the massive bed stands a night table with a phone, a picture of Khajag
Vahan, a book written in braille, as well as a lamp sit.  The other stand
holds a talking alarm clock.  There are drawers below the top of the stands
and several items are usually held within them.  Across from the bed stands
a massive armoire that holds clothing and nothing else.  Reds, blacks, and
grays predominate this space.  There isnt a window in this room, but the
area is large enough to afford lamps to brighten the space.

`oGuest Room`n~
The golds and reds of the living room continue into this space.  A large,
comfortable and uniquely Armenian bed, take over the space.  Night stands
flank the bed and offer an alarm clock, a lamp, books and a bonsai plant for
the comfort, and aesthetic appeal of the young assistant and of course
guests.  There is a television set in the room that is neither ancient nor
modern.  A sitting area sporting a small table and chair sit in the corner
and holds many books, a notebook, and a pencil.  To the right of the sitting
area, a closet sits and holds many of Carines clothes.  The rest of her
clothes are in a small dresser sitting beside the television.  A large
window offers a view of the street and light shines through, lightening up
the room during the day.  Sheer curtains, as well as heavier drapes are tied
back and frame the large window perfectly.

#GTulane University#n #w- Dormitory Room 101#n~
The same matte brown tiles that make up the flooring for the entire
dormitory, save for the bathrooms, can be found here.  No carpetting
attempts to cover the ever cold tile and no posters cover the pale salmon
pink walls.  Little decoration can be found in this dorm room.  There is a
bed in the far left-hand corner, a desk beneath the window, two beanbag
chairs (one neon pink and the other neon orange) on the right hand side of
the room and closer to the far wall than a dresser with shelving mounted on
top of it.  Everything is neat and tidy, not quite obsessively so as just
well-ordered.  The twin-sized dorm bed is standard except that hot pink
sheets contrast with the solid black comforter.

Soft feathery grey carpeting cover the small but comfortable space of the

desk of brown wood with black fittings sidles against one of the walls,
together with a grey-cushioned chair.  A bookcase with four shelves is
provided next to the desk.  Between two small walls near to the light green
door, a ceramic sink is fitted above light brown wooden cabinets.  The
western wall is occupied by a double window captured with white metal frames
surrounding clear glass, covered by white plastic blinds.  A chest of
drawers and a cupboard fits into the rest of the space the room allows and a
twin-sized bed with fitted sheets is placed perpendicular to the cupboard. 
The ceiling sports two rows of flourescent lighting and the room looks out
to the residential college garden compound of stone benches and old cypress
trees, and enclosed study areas.

#GTulane University #w- Second Floor Lounge#n~
Large comfortable couches of deep russet twill with dark red cushions
surround a rectangular hardwood table partially stained from hot bowls and
coffee cups.  Two bookshelves groan with the weight of a local library,
novels, old textbooks and other journals and aged magazines donated by
residents, current and former.  Newsletters and other circulars rise in a
stack on a small table jutting out by the side of one bookshelf; above which
a soft cork notice board is placed, pinned with many printed and handwritten
notices for the residential college's monthly events.  Opposite the couch, a
silver-grey flatscreen T.  V.  Sits on a long wooden cabinet and a couple of
gaming machines stack next to it, wires bundled neatly.  White-framed
windows shrouded with brown plastic blinds open up to an expansive view of
the university grounds, a good chunk of the rest of New Orleans visible
especially when the buildings and streets light up at night.  A short potted
dwarf palm lingers next to one of the windows, decorated with last year's
Christmas baubles.  The floor is carpeted with the same feathery grey as the
dormitory rooms with a few brightly colored rugs thrown here and there, to
add some warmness to the otherside drab interior.

The soft feathery grey carpeting that covers the small but comfortable
space of the dormitory room has been laden with a thick, fuzzy rug of white
shag, playing off walls painted a very light blue-white.  A well-organized
desk of brown wood with black fittings sidles against one of the walls,
together with a grey-cushioned chair with a random, white-cashmere throw
pillow tossed upon it's seat.  A bookcase with four shelves is provided next
to the desk, filled from top to bottom with stacked sketchpads, bouquets of
clustered pencils, charcoal pens and paint supplies.  Between two small
walls near to the light green door, a ceramic sink is fitted above light
ash-wooden cabinets.  The western wall is occupied by a double window
captured with white metal frames surrounding clear glass, covered by white
plastic blinds and a gauzy panel curtain of delicate faux-Parisian lace.  A
chest of drawers and a cupboard fits into the rest of the space the room
allows and a twin-sized bed with fitted Egyptian cotton sheets is placed
perpendicular to the cupboard.  The ceiling sports two rows of flourescent
lighting and the room looks out to the sprawling cypress-dotted landscape of
the campus, offering better scenery than the lower floor to compensate for
its spartan and simple furnishing.  The closed wooden door to the south
leads into a small washroom and shower shared by two residents.

with glass walls and a glass door fitted with a steel handle.  A shower head
and its accompanying plastic-protected heater is fixated to the white tiles
of the shower area wall.  Steel shelves are fitted on the opposite wall,
next to a rectangular mirror above a ceramic sink.  Towel bars and hooks are
also available both behind two doors leading into the washroom as well as
along one of the walls.  Three small ventilation windows open to the
outdoors, flanking a rotating ventilation fan which could be switched on
together with the flourescent lamps lighting the room.

creates an open air balcony space for students to gather for private
activities.

#GTulane University #w- Dormitory Balcony#n~
Extended outwards from the dormitory corridor is a open space protected
by brick walls at waist level, forming a sturdy barrier.  The top of the
walls are cemented and a bar railing in dark rusty pink is fixed along the
parapet.  Small pots of some plants and herbs jostle for space here, some
tucked tightly together on rusting metal lattice shelves.  Left over
cigarette butts can be seen inbetween the legs of the shelves or even
stuffed around the drain, other wise strangely litter-free.  The balcony
haunt appears quite popular for students to just sit around and admire the
landscape; an old plastic table folded up to lean against the side and
accompanying stools with worn legs stacked up near the wall, furnishing to
sit down at for a night-time gathering.  The scenery here extends beyond the
cypress-dominated lawn spread of the Tulane campus; one easily able to view
the most of the sights of New Orleans from here.

`wTraining Facility and Firing Range`n~
An entire portion of this basement beneath a basement has been closed off
with a heavy steel, roll-down cage, painted a dark hue of cerise red with a
latch that opens and closes from the inside, and a handle on the outside. 
Inside the cage are a few cushionless benches, arranged in a position that
allows them the best possible view of what's going on in the main room,
without risking being injured by whatever genre of training is going on at
any given time.  The entire floor is composed of dojo mats, set from one
wall to the other in interlocking, sand-coloured rectangles.  The cement
walls have been cushioned up to six feet from the ground with hefty offwhite
padding.  Racks of melee weaponry, practice body-armour and wooden or bamboo
blades are arranged within the long expanse of a cage-enclosed rack set
against one wall.  Down a set of six or seven cement stairs that sink into
the floor inside the proctective observers cage lies a dirt-floored shooting
range.  Individually sealed earplugs are piled into a green wicker basket
behind the place where the shooters would stand, and plastic sealed targets
in various 'perp' images are stacked here and there.  The range is a lengthy
space ended in stacks of hay bales.

`rRoom 1A`n~
Two four poster beds in dark, burnished pine sit on opposite sides of
this fair sized room, each bearing double memory-foam mattresses and a
thick, goose-down coverlet folded at the foot.  Heavy, hand-quilted blankets
and sheets of soft, clean cotton have been laden over each bed, both of
which have a polished wooden push stool with two steps to allow for ease in
climbing on.  A thick linen curtain in solid black can be pulled to a close
about the bed, forming a partial canopy to allow for complete privacy while
asleep.  Several cabinets are arranged on one wall, crafted of dark mahogany
with light engravings along the borders of the drawers, likely used for
stowing the personal effects of those who stay here.  The floor is covered
wholly in thick, plush, dark blue carpeting, and the roof is lower than in
the rest of the underground complex, with a very modern, elegant white
ceiling fan attached, providing light to the room from a frosted glass dome
at the center.  A clean kitchenette stocked with modern appliances and a
running sink fills a corner of the room, and another is closed off by thick,
concealing wooden screens, containing a faux-ivory bathtub, shower cubicle,
mirror and toilet.  Similar screens block off portions dedicated for
changing one's clothing in privacy.  A tea table is set in a comfortable
nook, with a pair of chairs on either side, both elegantly crafted of pine
and set with velvet cushions.

#oEarthen Entrance#g~
The ground itself here seems to have been dug out almost by hand.  The
cavern is very wide though not overly tall, perhaps six feet in height.  The
earth here is very dry, old dry roots are broken from the construction.  The
path seems heavily beaten as if there is much traffic through this cavern.

#eThe Bawn#g~
The underground tunnels open up into a rather large cavern.  The ceiling
is very high near fifteen feet in height with long thick stalagtites, water
dripping from them, echoing in the distance.  The ground is uneven in many
places, large stalagmites come up from the ground, you having to move your
way through them like a forest.  There are large puddles of stagnant water
pooled on the ground, every bit of rock is slick with water.  There is an
uneasy chill in the air at all times, a feeling of danger and warning fills
the air and your very soul.

#eAssembly Area#g~
Beyond the Bawn another even larger cavern is hollowed out, the highest
point of this massive cavern is near thirty feet, and wide enough to house a
number of families.  There are smaller caves set into the outer walls, some
at floor level, some at higher points in the cave, hand holes dug into the
rockface to access these small caves.  Each cave looks to be a living space,
filled with hay and other personal affects of no special recourse.  At the
very far end of the cavern is another large cave opening shaped in a large
gaping maw.  The room is lit by numerous stone hearths housing large
controlled fires.

#eSpiral Caern Heart#g~
This cavern is smaller then the last though can house a large group of
people.  Its rounded out the walls extremely smooth, the walls slick with a
strange unidentifiable ooze.  In the very center of the cave is a large
stone, rounded into a near perfect sphere.  Upon its surface are strange
arcane writings in a dark bile like color.  The sphere itself is also
covered in a strange ooze like substance.  At all times the ooze upon all
the surfaces seems to move, at times, a face can be seen within the
substance, dark whispers always heard though none comprehensible.

being so close to the village itself.

Within a large newly constructed house lies the very heart of the Caern. 
The house is about two stories in height with a roof made of hay and straw,
the center of the roof is left open to the sky above.  There is no second
floor everything is wide open, the ceiling held up by rafters.  The ground
is dirt beaten down very hard.  The very center of the home there is a
single tree that grows tall.  The leaves are always in full bloom nice and
green even in the winter months, the trunk is very strong.  A strange
feeling can be felt coming closer to this massive tree within.  Around the
tree like the outside, are a few large logs set around for seating if need
be.

This small road meanders and wanders around small hills and copses of

food and fodder for those inside the walls of Cordoba.  To the east can be
seen a large fores.  To the west a small Villa can be seen.

younger woman of great beauty.  The plaque on the bottom reads "Victor and
Maria Mendez".  There is a large table, oval, in the center with numerous
chairs around it.  In the very center is a candelabrum with a few old
candles atop them.

coming from under the door at the opposite end of the hallway.

#rStoreroom#g~
Entering a small storeroom one can see that it is full of boxes it seems
with mundane items within it, mostly from traders who have passed through
here for years, most now unusable and falling apart.  There is a small desk
in the room with a ledger of names, an inkwell and a quill.

There are about eight cells down this hallway, each one equipped with
simple locks and manacles.  Straw covers the cell floors.  The room smells
of sweat and viscera from all the past occupants.

A small stairwell goes down also made of wood that creeks with each step
that's taken leading down to a large oaken door that has a lock upon it. 
Its not a far decent the stairs number only four or five steps, the walls
are thick stone here as well, dark without much light available.

#rHaven#g~
The room is not overly large.  Each wall is made of stone except the
northern wall is just earth, packed up hard it seems.  Some places have
crumbled into the room, the smell of wet earth is always within the air.  In
the center of the room is a stone coffin like a crate with a stone lid.  If
opened the inside of the stone coffin, it's lined with soft fabrics, nothing
special of nature.  Against one of the walls is a book shelf with a few
tomes of no real worth or interest.  There is also a desk with a book upon
it seeming to be a journal.

`cDr`C.`c Monroe`C'`cs Office`C;`c Waiting Room`n~
Walking into the waiting room of Dr.  Monroes office, the ambiance calms
and sooths even the most troubled of souls.  Soft music is piped into the
room, usually classical, and several professionally reproduced works of the
masters are displayed on the wall.  Soft, well worn, biscuit colored Italian
leather couches provide the utmost of comfort, and a cherry wood coffee
table has different magazines strewn about, offering clients many different
reading options.  The floor is covered with plush maroon carpet and the
walls are a warm moccasin that emphasize the artwork on the walls perfectly.
Recessed lighting casts a warm glow over the entire room complimenting the
serene environment.  The only other framed objects on the wall are Dr. 
Monroes diplomas and accredidations; His undergraduate from The University
of Michigan Ann Arbor, his masters and doctorate from Stanford, and licenses
from several psychological associations in various countries, including the
APA and several different European associations.  There are two doors made
of six panal cherry wood.  The one facing west leads to the office of Dr. 
Monroe, and the other, to the north, once unlocked, opens to a staircase
that leads up to his studio appartment.

`cDr`C.`c Monroe`C'`cs Office`n~
Continuing the comfortable quality of the waiting room, Dr.  Monroes
office boasts quality reproductions, maroon carpeting and moccasin colored
walls.  The music that was heard in the waiting room is inaudible here, but
a white noise machine sits in the corner.  A biscuit Italian leather lounge
is placed against the wall and offers a familiar comfort for clients.  A
matching leather chair, facing the lounge is reserved for Dr.  Monroe and
usually holds a pad of paper and a pen encased in zebrawood on the right
arm.  A half moon cherry wood desk sits in the far corner and holds several
papers, none of any importance and two separate phones.  One is an off white
phone that is intended for clients.  The other, a black phone is only for a
special use; it rarely rings.  While Dr.  Monroe is in session, the phones
and any other disruptive apparatus is turned off to ensure peace.  Behind
the desk sits a rolling leather office chair that matches the other Italian
leather furniture.

`cDr`C.`c Monroe`C'`cs Office`C;`c Studio`n~
After walking up the stairs from the traditional, comfortable waiting
room, one notices a drastic change in decor.  The floors are covered in
black stained oak floors and the walls are stark white.  Many black and
white photographs are hung on two of the walls; a common theme of the seven
deadly sins runs through all of the pictures on one wall, the seven contrary
virtues on the opposite.  An erotic photo of two lovers represents lust; A
single nude figure sitting on a black couch, in a black room, his head in
his hands embodies sloth; Wrath is exhibited by a spray of glass, a man in
the background, who threw the object, is contorted with rage, ugly and
ferocious; Pride is shown as several mirrored faces, all with a smug,
uncaring features and dead eyes; A man counting money as a woman reaches out
for him lovingly, represents greed; Gluttony is demonstrated through a
starving child being pushed away by a man eating a lavish meal; and finally,
envy is manifested in the form of a man stealing anothers life through
murder.  Along this wall of sins sits a black leather couch, and on either
side of the grusome art sit two black bookshelves, stuffed with
psychological texts, criminology texts and other such books.  Across the way
is another sitting area, with photos representing the seven contrary
virtues, a white couch and white bookshelves.  It is quite clear that the
sofa by the sins is used more often than the one by the photographs of of
virtues.  Off to the left is a small kitchen which is very modest, virtually
unused and as modern as the rest of his apartment.  Against the far wall, a
large black armoir sits.  Nestled within this large piece of furniture is a
king sized murphy bed.  And on either side of the opened bed are hidden
alcoves that hold pictures of his parents, a plane crash, and a picture of
him as a sickly young man, circles under his eyes and track marks on his
arms.  The bed is covered in crimson sheets and comforters.  This is the
only color of note in Dr.  Monroes living quarters There is no television in
his apartment, just a bose system that plays music softly and constantly. 
Next to the Armoir, on the north side of the room, a black six panneled door
sits and opens to the bathroom.

`cDr`C.`c Monroe`C'`cs Office`C;`c Bathroom`n~
The stark, modern, minimalist appraoch to decorating is continued into
the bathroom.  The black floors and white walls continue into the bathroom
where sits a white pedestal sink, white toilet and a rather large white
jacuzzi tub.  A linen cabinet sits next to the toilet and holds black and
white bath towels, hand towels and washcloths.  Extra bed linens are also
held in the black cabinet.  There is a small mirror over the sink and a
framed piece of parchment hangs over the toilet.  It reads: humility against
pride, kindness against envy, abstinence against gluttony, chastity against
lust, patience against wrath, liberality against greed, and diligence
against sloth: Prudentius was a fool.

Delectably Victorian in design, the cozy interior of the Attic is a place
for the antique buff to visit, if not for the teas served but for drinking
up the delightful dcor within.  Designed like a nineteenth century tea-room
in mind, with ivory painted walls and decorative cornices, the brass lamps
hanging down from the ceiling radiate a romantic warm glow over the
interior.  Oak tables and high backed chairs veneered with a rich vintage
brown are set with white tablecloths, china and silver cutlery.  Apart from
a formal dining area, cushy armchairs and small tables hug the area near the
long glass windows.  The small counter comes with a large refrigerated glass
display for cakes and pastries.  Freshly baked muffins and sconces sit on
trays on the counter together with large glass jars of cookies, a pile of
#pmenu#n's bound in red leather and an cash register.  Behind, a tall
cupboard towers, its shelves filled with bags and canisters of tea.

Separated from behind the counter by a set of deep red wooden doors, the
kitchen of the Eclectic Attic is a clean arrangement of white cabinets,
black counter-tops and stainless steel equipment.  Classic copper pots are
hung on hooks above the combined oven and stove while cabinets built over a
rectangular work-top tiled with a single slab of veined marble hold various
components for baking and cooking.  A cheery yellow Kitchen-Aid mixer sits
on side of the marble slab, reflecting a large refrigerator with matte steel
doors opposite it.  Near to the door is another counter piled with chinaware
and the latest espresso machine.  The tiled walls of the kitchen are covered
with large laminated arthouse-style food photography.  Tucked in one corner
is a smaller room for the shops staff to rest.  A winding stair-case of
metal steps exits into the apartment above.

#PAn Apartment above the Eclectic Attic#n~
Compared to the assortment of vintage articles in the tea-room below,
this apartment appears overtly spacious with its surprising lack of
furniture.  A low black table is placed in the middle of what is a living
room and surrounded by large white beanbags.  A flat-screen TV set with an
attached stereo sits on a plain shelf opposite, adorned by a
Victorian-inspired wooden clock and a porcelain mermaid statue.  Books are
arranged on a five-tiered shelf next to a painting of Van Gogh's 'Starry
Starry Night', against the pale green wall.  Below the painting is a squat
glass table on which a small, white laptop lies.  Two coffee-brown doors
keep the entrances to the bedroom and another guest room closed.  A small
flight of metal stairs leads to the building's roof-top.

#PA Roof-Top overlooking Dauphin Street#n~
A small roof top paved with terra-cotta tiles overlook the buildings of
Dauphin Street and the entertainment bustle of Bourbon Street beyond.  A
parapet of darker red bricks is built around the square roof-top, hanging
upon it are wooden flowerboxes filled with a variety of garden herbs and
local blooms.  From one end of the rooftop to the other, a long clothesline
hangs, articles of clothing flapping away on it at times.  A small barbeque
in red and black metal is tucked away at one spot, covered with a canvas
sheet to protect it.  A twisted iron table and accompanying chairs fit into
the other corner, sheltered by an almost toppling umbrella of dark green. 
The only oddity in this place would be a rather large dragon-fruit cactus
growing out of a huge pot at one end of the roof-top.

#pInside the yard of a Monastery#n~
The yard is a quiet place with only the sounds of the occasional animal. 
A few goats stroll around eating usually whatever they can find.  Here and
there a chicken clucks or scratches the ground looking for something to eat.
This area is mainly just grass for the animals to graze on.  Over to the
southwest is a small vegetable garden and to the north is a small barn. 
Many paths worn into the grass by the monks who care for this Monastery lead
off in several directions.

#pThe northeast corner of the yard#n~
A small barn used to store tools and sometimes hay or other feed for the
animals, stands here.  The door seems to be in disrepair and has been
removed from its hinges.  It stands leaning against the wall of the barn.  A
short ramp leads into the interior of the building.  Over to the west stands
another long building, probably stables for horses as the soft sound of the
occasional whiney can be heard.  A foot path worn by constant use heads both
west and to the south.

#pThe north side of the yard#n~
The stables stand here taking up quite a bit of room.  They reach all the
way nearly flush with the far western wall.  Combined with the barn the two
buildings make an effective barrier against the harsh north wind.  Two
entrances allow both incoming and outgoing traffic to move unimpeded.  Short
ramps lead up inside the stables making it easier to move the horses in and
out.  A worn wooden weather vane spins silently in the breeze blowing above
the stables.  The horses inside seem to be aware of your presense and a few
of them snort or whiney making their discomfort known.  A worn foot path
leads to the west and the east.

The other entrance for the stables is here, a bit of mud has dried on the
ramp leading inside.  This door seems to be more of an exit however than an
entrance as most of the tracks in the dirt from the horses are leading away.
The stables seem very well constructed and clearly taken care of from the
few repairs which can be seen.  Towards the west, outside the wall a small
graveyard can be seen surrounded by another small stone wall.  A dirt foot
path leads to the east and south from here.

#pBehind the Monastery#n~
Consisting of mainly grass and a few paths, this area doesn't seem to get
much use.  Even the paths worn through the grass have begun to grow over
from lack of use.  A small gate, much like the one you used to enter the
yard originally, hangs here keeping animals from wandering off.  A small
cemetary can be seen only a few hundred feet outside the gate.  One foot
path leads to a back door in the Monastery building itself.  Another leads
off to the south.

#pThe southwest corner of the yard#n~
The vegetable garden grows all the way from where it starts in the
southern part of the yard, clear back to the western wall.  A small path
leads around the side of the Monastery leading toward the rear of the
building.  A cemetery can just be made out off to the west.  High above you
rises the bell tower of the Monastery.  From here you can just make out what
looks like a bird's nest built where the tower meets the rest of the roof. 
Apparently people aren't the only ones who enjoy God's house.

Stretching out before you is a beautiful vegetable garden.  Many types
and varieties of vegetables have been planted.  The garden looks well cared
for and is completely free of any kind of weed or grass.  A fairly sturdy
stick fence surrounds the garden to keep the animals from eating the
vegitables.  A path leads from the small gate to the garden straight up
toward the church building where a side door can be seen.  Another foot path
continues west toward the back wall of the yard.

#pThe southeast corner of the yard#n~
More grass grows here for the animals to eat.  The foot path seems to cut
diagonally across this area leading to a large vegetable garden growing
along the southern wall.  A few animals nip and bite at the grass keeping it
short, even someone's horse has been left to wander freely.  A small pond,
likely formed by collected rainwater, serves to provide the animals with a
drink.  A little closer to the wall stands a well for the monks to get
water.  A small crude roof has been constructed over the well to prevent
rainwater from filling it.  A bucket connected to a long rope sits on the
rim of the well waiting to be used.

Two tall wooden doors open into the large worship area.  While not as
high as many of the larger churches, the ceilings in this Monastery are yet
vaulted rising maybe twenty feet from the floor.  The workmanship is
beautiful and a dozen arches, like huge ribs hold the roof high above.  A
spectacular round stained glass window sits just above the doors.  Its image
is of two hands folded together in prayer and surrounded by a bright light. 
Further west inside the Monastery row upon row of pews stands waiting for
visitors.

#pRows and rows of pews#n~
At least a dozen pews stand on either side of a central aisle which leads
to the Altar at the front of the church.  All of them are made of dark
mahogany and are beautifully constructed as if whoever commissioned the
building of this church certainly could afford to spare no expense.  On
either wall at a uniform height of aproximately eight feet above the floor
are six stained glass windows.  Each depicts a different scene.  One in
particular screams for attention.  It seems to be the scene in the bible
where Caine slays his brother Able.  A small #Cplaque#n is positioned beneath
it.

The Altar stands here.  In the center of the large altar is a statue of
the Virgin Mary holding an infant Christ.  Starting on the left and moving
to the right in sequence are several scenes behind this.  The first one
depicts His birth and events as such.  While the Virgin and Child might
occupy a central position, the surrounding panels develope a central theme
focused on Christ as Savior, depicting His Incarnation, Passion, Death and
Resurrection, and especially the Eucharist, or Last Supper.  A door stands
off to the left of the Altar and kind of hidden in shadows of the west wall.

Hanging from the huge bell at the top of the tower is a very thick rope

need be to climb the bell tower.  A hallway leads off in both directions,
north and south.  A door leads outside to the west and a door leads back
into the main part of the Monastery to the east.

#pThe top of the bell tower#n~
A narrow platform runs around the inside of the bell tower.  Open portals
in all four walls offer a somewhat restricted three hundred and sixty degree
view of the surrounding area.  A road can be seen off to the northeast. 
Cordoba can be made out in the distance to the north.  A small cemetary lies
near the church to the west.  The forests masks any real view of the south. 
The windows in the tower are constructed in such a way so as to keep rain
out and consequently also allow someone to look out at the yard around the
church without they themselves being observed easily.  The enormous church
bell hangs here as well, one would certainly not want to be here in the
event that it was rung, the resulting sound could potentially be deafening.

items.  Above the head of the bed hangs simple wooden crucifix.  On the
other side of the room is a simple table, sitting on the table is plain
rosary with many worn beads and a small crucifix.

This room is not made for comfort, it is made with nessecity in mind.  A
simple wooden bed with a small pad as a matress rests against one wall.  A
trunk sits at the foot of the bed for clothes and maybe one or two personal
items.  Above the head of the bed hangs simple wooden crucifix.  On the
other side of the room is a simple table, laying open on top of the table is
a bible.  It is currently open to Psalm 23, the Lord's Prayer.

#pA narrow hallway#n~
A narrow hallway is lined with many doors here.  Each door is very simple
and completely without decoration of any kind.  The door to the south seems
to lead outside from here.  All along the north wall is a beautiful fresco
depicting the the story of Christ in sort of a timeline from His birth to
His death and finally His ressurection.

#pPath behind the Monastery#n~
Tall weeds stand to either side of the path leading to the cemetary. 
Most are only waist high but, as thick as they are, anything could be hiding
amongst them.  To the west are the small cemetery gates and back to the east
stands the Monastery.  The wind picks up for just a moment and the rustle of
the weeds suddenly masks every other sound except for the dry stalks rubbing
together.  A sound, almost like an eerie scream can barely be heard on the
wind, as if it may or may not have been there.

The gravestones here are certainly very well tended.  Not a single weed
grows within the small stone wall which surrounds the small graveyard.  Most
of the #Cheadstone#ns are pretty much the same with a few exceptions.  A
chill wind seems to blow through the small cemetary all year round as if an
odd reminder that this is truly a place of the dead.  More headstones can be
seen in every direction except east which leads back to the Monastery.

The inside of the barn is somewhat warm, and very dry.  The hay stacked
around the walls seems to keep it well insulated.  Garden tools stand along
the walls or hang from racks on the ceiling.  The room is not very big after
you consider all the hay, maybe only ten feet square with a thick wooden
beam in the middle to support the roof.

#eCanal Street (Avg. NPCs: 55)#n~
Stone grey, brown and maroon brickwork embodies the distinct form of
Canal Street as 1920's vogue; buildings each individually structured to be
formal, grand and appealing to the senses while at the same time mundane,
conforming to the purpose of their design - that being mostly aged apartment
buildings, restaurants and clubs - all vying for prominence, and in effect
becoming squashed, wedged and messy in segmented blocks; all the while
outdone and outclassed by the towering prongs of a decade or so later;
jagged sky-scraping structures loom into dominance in their occasional
appearance along the lengthy Canal.  Narrow windows peer out onto a wide
street lit by lamps or all hues between dying orange and vibrant white, and
neon-buzzing business fronts; each contrasting with the glimmers of traffic
signals and the occasional alleyway tipped with a burning barrel.  Roaming
youths, staggering street ladies, huddled homeless and shattered bottles
reveal the culture that exists illuminated by moonlight.  #gThe Audobon
Nature Institute#n, a complex of five buildings in a planned layout of
forest and lawns, lies down a short lane to the west.

#gAudubon Nature Institute#n~
A few buildings of five to six stories in height are placed in a planned
layout amidst what seems to be a peaceful forest of tall cypresses and
maintained grass lawns.  Pavements link each building to each other, large
plastic plaques on each of these buildings indicate the departments and
facilities available in them.  Electric lampposts line most of the
pavements, keeping them lighted.  The buildings themselves have large
windows, some of which dark, while others, an encased flourescent glow emits
from them.  A large parking lot is found near to the entrance into the
building, a paybooth with a barricade stationed at the exit.  The Institute
is fenced in by a tall, dark brown metal fence running around the entire
perimeter.

#oMusee d'Art#n #w-#n Main Hall~
The grand, carved mahogany double doors of the gallery lead on into an
immense hall of surpisingly modern, minimalist style.  Despite the notable
lack of windows, the clever illumination techniques boast subtle, recessed
lights within the distressed oak flooring, as well as strategically placed
spotlights hung from the ceiling high overhead, the gentle glow reflecting
softly in the matte white of the walls to lend a distinct atmosphere to the
space.  The collections on display vary from month to month.  From
impressionism, to surrealist, art nouveau to expressionist; the walls and
floor of the magnificent gallery are always filled with fascinating
paintings and sculptures, helpful attendants and tourguides wanderig
unhurriedly among the crowds to offer details.  At the northern end of the
building, reached by a simple staircase against the far western wall, the
steps painted the exact hue of their surroundings, a small cafe can be seen
overlooking the main hall, located atop an open plan inner balcony and
bearing simple columns that close the remaining space to the ceiling. 
Beneath, on the ground floor, the same space has been walled off, appearing
to house the gallery's offices.  A simple, panelled wood door enters it, a
small silver plaque declaring it 'private'.  Scattered around the perimeter
of the floor, amidst the supporting pillars, several low benches of brushed
tan leather are placed before some of the larger or more well known pieces.

This vast space, though bare, remains surprisingly warm and well
ventilated, likely to ensure no damage befalls the often priceless contents
of the several hundred crates housed within it.  Lacking windows, the
storage area is lit overhead by inexpensive flourescent bars, which hang
from the impressively high ceiling amidst the interlacing pipes and air
conditioning shafts.  Though bright, the simple volume of shelves and the
enormous size of the space means that much is left in shadow.  Three
enormous, ceiling-high double doors dominate the northern wall, leading out
onto the streets.  While the upper portion comprises of panelled glass,
reinforced by wire mesh, the remainder is crafted from solid wood, likely
from the original days of the stately home.  An unassuming staircase rises
against the western wall, leading into a short hallway.  Simply decorated,
it's floor of nothing more elaborate than old, worn tiling, the passage
leads to a single door.

Not overly large, this elegant office is nevertheless stylish and
evidence of an individual taste in decor.  The walls bear a warm terracotta
hue, each panel detailed painstakingly with egyptian hieroglyphs, a shade or
two darker, the beading that surrounds each finished in a glossy dark
woodstain that dully reflects the gentle lighting of the office, providing a
serene, quiet ambience.  An enormous solid mahogany desk opposite the doors
is scattered with various documents, ranging from official looking forms, to
scribbled notes and hastily drawn layouts for the gallery's main hall.  A
sturdy, upholstered office chair sits behind it, obviously having seen
better days, the fabric a little worn and jaded, the wooden arms smooth from
use.  Opposite this, set at equal angles before the desk, two comfortable
looking armchairs reside expectantly.  The northern wall displays an immense
tapestry of unclear origin, it's deep crimson and gold hues working well
with the rooms color scheme, while the eastern wall is dominated by arching
wooden double doors, their upper halves panelled with beautifully detailed
engraved glass.

#oMusee d'Art#n #w-#n #gLe Jardin Cafe#n~
Overlooking the vast floorspace of the main gallery below, this small
cafe has a relaxed, bohemian atmosphere, yet still with a touch of elegance.
Trailing ivy meanders between the railings of the balcony's wrought iron,
which is segmented equally by four solid white pillars, rising to the
ceiling.  Plush, enticingly soft pairs of brushed suede couches face each
other about the area for those who wish a comfortable place to sit, while
high, wooden tables remain for those simply partaking in a snack,
accompanied by velvet covered stools of equal height.  No music thwarts the
relaxed, peaceful sounds of the gallery's patrons or the bustle of the
servers and waitresses behind the long dark wood counter, facing the stairs.
All similarly attired in well tailored shirts of dark green, bearing the
logo of Le Jardin, the staff seem to comprise mainly of young people, likely
students.  Blackboard menus bear today's offerings upon them in a flowing
script, a quaint selection of pastries and sandwiches, as well as various
herbal teas and flavored coffees.

#oLuxurious apartment#n #w-#n #cParlor#n~
Contrasting with the minimalist chic of the gallery, this lounge is
almost over-indulgent in it's use of luxurious fabrics and the general
opulence of it's interior.  The polished mahogany doors that open inward
boast exquisite glass panels, all combining in a beautifully detailed
engraving of thorned roses and fragile doves in flight.  A thick, deep pile
carpet of a soft, creamy, off-white shade weaves it's neutral hue soothingly
in with the more luscious shades of the furniture.  Ornate couches and
parlor chairs with upholstery of a faded, embroidered teal and cushions of
white and gold are placed apparently randomly around the obviously antique
coffee table that acts as a centerpiece.  Of a mid-colored wood, likely
solid mahogany, it's surface is inlaid with an intricate, swirling pattern
of rose blossoms and vines, mirroring the carvings that decorate the frame
and legs.  The panelled walls themselves are painted a deep grey, with
classical moulding and elaborate details painted off-white, the bold choice
adding drama to the eclectic mixture of pieces in the lounge.  The room is
illuminated by a simple chandelier, hung from an engraved centerpiece at the
ceiling's centre and during cold weather is heated by the enormous carved
fireplace within the northern wall.  A few tasteful ornaments decorate the
mantle.  Flanked either side by floor to ceiling french windows, swathed in
thickly lined curtains of colored silk and metallic thread brocaded on silk
damask, at night the windows are flung open, overlooking the sights and
sounds of Bourbon Street from a relaxed distance, each embellished with a
small patio.  A stunning, ebonized sideboard is placed against the wall, a
pewter dish atop it bearing white tapered candles of various size,
leatherbound books lining the wall to the rear.  Carved mahogany
double-doors lead south, a smaller single panelled door in the western wall
leading to the entrance hall and stairs.

#oLuxurious apartment#n #w-#n #cBedroom#n~
Gleaming golds and luxurious creams entwine this high-ceilinged room in a
relaxed seduction of the senses.  The pile carpet underfoot is of a serene
baby-blue, contrasting in tasteful elegance against the more neutral hues in
the remainder of the bedroom.  The southern wall boasts trailing curtains of
an enthralling golden damask, the pelmet running the entire length of the
wall.  Only the occasional stirring breeze reveals that they conceal french
windows, leading out onto the iron-laced gallery.  A French Louisiana
adaptation to the heat of New Orleans, the combination of balcony and
courtyard offers breathtaking views of Royal Street beyond the modest garden
established around the railings.  The sweet smell of the fragrant blossoms
often meanders it's way into the bedroom.  Against the western wall stands
an enormous bed, furnished with tall corner posts and draped in the softest,
barely opaque muslin canopy.  The teal and amber hues of the expensive
looking sheets co-ordinate well with the room's decor, a scattering of
similarly hued tasselled cushions adding a tempting touch of comfort. 
Subtle panelled doors take up the entirety of the eastern wall opposite,
likely housing an expansive wardrobe.  Filling the space between, a few
beautifully upholstered armchairs, a matching chaise lunge reclining at the
foot of the bed.

thick old ropes in pale honey tones suspend above the theatre, which is
fully visible in all it's former glory below one's feet.  From here the
curtains are drawn and closed, lights are hung, sandbags dangle and boxes of
electrical supplies lie.  A rope ladder leads one to an alcove backstage,
with one or two rungs rotted off.

Below a well visible trap door in the backstage area, fitting flawlessly
into the dusty wood flooring, is a long, winding staircase, just wide enough
to allow one person to walk at a time.  The walls are of smooth carved stone
with ornate iron mounts every ten or so feet, most containing burned out
torches.  The stairs are crafted of wood planks, covered in dust and reeking
of mold, and at the bottom lies what appears to be a basement, almost wholly
empty and utterly devoid of decoration.  Rats squeak in the rotting ceiling
above, the floor is of packed earth, and the sole object of note is an
absolutely massive black furnace, cold and unused.

`oThe Antechamber`n~
Upon finishing the disgusting descent through the refuse ridden sewer pipe,
a huge art gallery would be found. The trash prevalent in the upper portions
is now completely missing, and there is not a rat or insect in sight. The
faint smell of roses wafts in the air, and the room is well-lit by chandeliers 
hanging from the ceiling. A quartet of thrones sit on a carpeted dias on one 
side of the room, arranged in a diamond shape facing the west, where the pipe
itself bottoms out. Scupltures of all size and shape adorn various pedestals 
throughout, and lining the walls are tapestries of various great events in 
history, both local and worldwide. There is a large, antique oaken desk 
placed in one corner of the room, manned by an everpresent ghoul. Soft tunes 
of classical music from various great composers waft over the entire artistic 
assembly, and shadows are long banished by the electrically lit crystal 
chandeliers. The are several plush velvet chairs arranged methodically through
the room, and racks with newspapers, magazines, and books dot the spaces next
to the chairs.

#eBase of a vast, rock wall shrouded by trees#n~
`gA solid rock, smooth grey cliff faces the clearing to the west, hidden
almost completely by the dense branches of trees laden heavily with pale
olive Spanish Moss.  Until one has as good as run into the cliff they would
hardly know it's there, regardless of the fact that it runs a good hundred
feet into the air from the base point to the apparantly inaccesible plateau
on top.  In the face of the rock itself is etched a gently glowing, greenish
`Gglyph`g, no larger than a half dollar, drawing the eye toward itself, and
thus the rectangular door it marks, which would be as good as seamless -
utterly unrecognizeable - were it not for the dimly glowing mark.  The door
can be edged open if one knows the way`n `gin.  `n

Various dark stonework hues pattern the distinct face of Elysian Fields,
a stretch of New Orleans paved in fond honor of Paris' Champs Elysees.  The
four-lane street arcs south with a subtle curve, laden on either side with
bright gas lamps in the old Victorian style, each casting a halo of white
illumination across the aged asphault below.  Light colored sidewalks run
alongside the road, and the gutters are kept clear of most synthetic debris;
dried leaves and othersuch foliage provide a brownish film, and streams of
water trickle toward drains.  An echo of the distant Canal Street, Elysian
Fields offers a dizzying meld of structure types.  Old plantation homes
encased by high iron fences that hide away their Spanish courtyards and
gardens, expensive, five star restaurants and upscale nightclubs or smoking
lounges all nestle into place, differing from it's western cousin in the
lack of chaos these closely arranged places portray.  Everything appears to
be perfectly in it's place, with just enough space to be cozy without
cramping.

a stretch of New Orleans paved in fond honor of Paris' Champs Elysees.  The
four-lane street arcs south with a subtle curve, laden on either side with
bright gas lamps in the old Victorian style, each casting a halo of white
illumination across the aged asphault below.  Light colored sidewalks run
alongside the road, and the gutters are kept clear of most synthetic debris;
dried leaves and othersuch foliage provide a brownish film, and streams of
water trickle toward drains.  An echo of the distant Canal Street, Elysian
Fields offers a dizzying meld of structure types.  Old plantation homes
encased by high iron fences that hide away their Spanish courtyards and
gardens, expensive, five star restaurants and upscale nightclubs or smoking
lounges all nestle into place, differing from it's western cousin in the
lack of chaos these closely arranged places portray.  Everything appears to
be perfectly in it's place, with just enough space to be cozy without
cramping.

them, their solid marble eyes regarding those who pass them by with
expressionless indifference.

`gChartres Street (Avg. NPCs: 0)`n~
This wide street is all but wholly abandoned after nightfall, leaving the
majority of traffic solely to the occasional car that creeps through,
headlights always off, so as not to disturb the intenteded feel of antiqued
suffocation.  Cypress and willow trees have been left to overgrow, and
heavy, thick branches hang down over the street, obscuring even the moon and
starlight to a barely present, dim source of illumination.  Absolutely no
cars are parked on Chartres, and by all counts it appears to be almost
wholly abandoned.  No lights are on in the windows of the lobbies of the
various hotels, all businesses appear to be closed - apartment flats have
boarded up windows and the enclosures about the Spanish styled courtyards
that encircle each private villa show clear signs of disuse in broken and
rusted locks, vines growing wild and various debris.  Mostly empty pots
dangle from the balconies that layer the front of most buildings, the few
still living plants offering the only discernable tamed greenery.

`oBourbon Street (Avg. NPCs: 202)`n~
The heavy reek of sweat, vomit and less savoury human wastes are well
present on this world famous stretch of land, filled with tightly packed
hordes of tourists, bars, glittering strings of beads and more than an ample
share of nudity.  The gutters that border the wide old sidewalks on either
side of the thickly populated street are filled with a layer of various
squelching liquids; anything dropped onto the ground here is better left
where it lies.  Cheap, potent alcoholic drinks fill almost every hand, and
people kneel or flop onto the cobblestones to empty their stomachs almost
everywhere one chooses to look.  A thousand sources of music in various
genres - though heavy, often soothing jazz is in the majority - pours out
the open doors of clubs and bars.  Buzzing, neon lit signs are mounted above
the doors of the seemingly endless supply of strip joints.  The often
massive statures of bouncers are as frequent a sight as half naked
strippers, lingering on the stoops of their affiliated clubs.  A clean red
awning hangs over the street to the south, marking the transition from the
filth and debauchery of Bourbon Street to the quaint row of Elysian Fields;
a brightly colored sign reads `rE`ym`Gp`bo`pr`ri`yu`Gm`o of`r W`yo`Gn`bd`pe`rr`ys`G.`n

constant, violent echo of party goers, drug addicts and drunks is present as
a dull white-noise roar.  Parked cars line either side of the street in all
states of function, some grown over with vines and covered in a thick layer
of dust, some quite polished and clean.  A few parking lots turn off the

`pBurgundy Street (Avg. NPCs: 2)`n~
Packed on all sides with chipped-brick apartment buildings that cast long
shadows across the narrow, Cypress choked road, Burgundy is a solely
residential area, neither rich nor poor, thus displaying a dizzying meld of
both run-down structures, cracked sidewalks and aging shotgun homes blended
in with one-story Parisian condos and their enclosed courtyards.  Granite
gargoyles top wrought iron fences, looming strategically overhead with their
twisted faces turned into malicious grimaces.  Black iron, intricate
balconies line the apartment complexes, occasionally holding some personal
effect of the residents, though the majority are empty and dark, mere
open-faced pods by the thousands where people can stand or sit to watch the
goings on below.  Jasmine and vines grow thick, pushing wild through the
sidewalks and suffocating the lesser maintained of buildings.  The gutters
are filled with their share of litter, and the tall, gothic-Victorian
streetlamps from an age where gas, not electricity, was used to illuminate
them have never been modified to suit the modern age, lying dark and filled
with cobwebs instead of bulbs.

`pBurgundy Street (Avg. NPCs: 2)`n~
Packed on all sides with chipped-brick apartment buildings that cast long
shadows across the narrow, Cypress choked road, Burgundy is a solely
residential area, neither rich nor poor, thus displaying a dizzying meld of
both run-down structures, cracked sidewalks and aging shotgun homes blended
in with one-story Parisian condos and their enclosed courtyards.  Granite
gargoyles top wrought iron fences, looming strategically overhead with their
twisted faces turned into malicious grimaces.  Black iron, intricate
balconies line the apartment complexes, occasionally holding some personal
effect of the residents, though the majority are empty and dark, mere
open-faced pods by the thousands where people can stand or sit to watch the
goings on below.  Jasmine and vines grow thick, pushing wild through the
sidewalks and suffocating the lesser maintained of buildings.  The gutters
are filled with their share of litter, and the tall, gothic-Victorian
streetlamps from an age where gas, not electricity, was used to illuminate
them have never been modified to suit the modern age, lying dark and filled
with cobwebs instead of bulbs.

`bNorth Rampart Street (Avg. NPCs: 2)`n~
Far removed from it's southern brothers, North Rampart Street bears no
real nightlife, no party-goers, and no tourists; what people there are
travel in clusters, huddling close to one another around barrels filled with
burning debris, or moving quick by the mouths of narrow alleyways reeking of
vomit, urine and worse.  The majority of streetlamps - being all of mundane,
modern design; none of the elegant Victorian replicas have carried over to
this portion of the city - are burned out or yellowed, buzzing sources of
light, often flickering on and off to leave anyone below in complete
darkness.  The occasional car creeps by, and from time to time a lone
individual can be seen settling down against the wall of an old shot-gun
styled building.

`eParking lot of a Chevron Station and truck-stop diner (Avg. NPCs: 52)`n~
A vast parking lot with cracked, aged and greying asphault supports space
for several dozen 18-wheelers at the back, and a couple dozen spaces
outlined in white paint for regular vehicles.  To the east of the lot,
closest to the big truck spaces, lies an old gas station, the pumps out
front only numerous enough to accomadate one lane of customers.  A large
glowing sign displays the gas prices for unleaded, premium and diesel,
labelling the station as `bChevron`n in blue and white.  To the south of the
lot, with a curving sidewalk encircling the face, lies a one-story structure
with a huge, flickering neon sign reading simply '`GThe Diner`n' in green. 
Large, grimy windows display padded booths and speckled teal tables.  A pair
of cement steps lead to the glass doors of the diner.

`GThe Diner (Avg. NPCs: 30)`n~
A black and white tiled floor, barstools padded in maroon leather and
numerous booths that line the entire interior face of the diner offer a
distinctly 1950s feel to this truck-stop, supported in full by the old
fashioned milkshake machines and fountain soda.  The smell of frying
potatoes, various breakfast foods, thick homestyle soups and grilling
burgers is heavy, mingled in with the slightly less savoury hint of
cigarette smoke that wafts in when the glass door opens and closes. 
Waitresses bustle to and fro, popping gum and looking bored with their
cork-lined, circular trays and paper menus.  A large neon clock sits against
the wall behind the counter, nestled between flyers advertising everything
from cars for sale to babysitters and second-hand furniture or appliances. 
The neverending whir of old machinery keeps the place sounding busy even
when customers are sparse; a condition which rarely occurs.  Each booth
contains two benches padded in maroon leather and a gaudy teal table.

`bChevron Gas Station (Avg. NPCs: 3-4)`n~
A very cramped space with just enough room to accomadate four aisles
packed on all sides with packages of candy, snacks, colorful bags of chips
and random personal grooming products, and the enclosed space for the
cashier.  The ceiling is low, with a fan pushing the somewhat fetid swamp
air about without really managing to cool it.  Two mini-fans sit mounted in
the cashier space, blowing gusts onto the person sitting within it.  The
floor is sticky, grey cement, and a narrow metal door offers a unisex
bathroom.  Racks of cigarettes and six packs or forties of various cheap
beer fill a wall mounted cooler, accompanying clear plastic bags of ice.

`gPast the broad entryway revealed by the sliding of the stone door, a
small cavern is revealed, filled with little but darkness, thick mosses in
varying shades of grey, green and brown, and intricate, ancient stalagmites
that drip melodically into shallow puddles of clear water on the smooth,
dirt cave floor.  At the direct center of the cavern is a large opening,
leading down into the hard layers of earth and bedrock by way of spiraling
stairs composed of solid rock, hewn, shaped and smoothed with rock walls on
either side.  `n

descends the smooth stairs into the earth.  The temperature drops, losing
the stagnant, humid feel and cooling.  Something clean, earthen and pure
fills the air, and shallow carvings graffiti the walls every few steps,
displaying countless glyphs and symbols varying in intricacy.  At the base
of the stair can be seen the warm glow of firelight.  `n

muffling footsteps into near silence in even the most bumbling of

and hanging low with multicolored mineral stalagmites in others.  Everywhere
the walls have been covered with carvings depicting tales of glory,
celebration and tragedy, etched directly into the pale grey stone.  Every
dozen feet a torch is mounted into the wall, filling the tunnel with warmth

working it's way up into the ceiling and bedrock.  `n

still living logs of hearty wood, their healthy green foliage sticking out

`eThe Alpha's Quarters`g (Gauntlet: 3)`n~
This room is kept dark and fragrant, candles litter the room, sitting on
the floor, small stools, even the only thing that would resemble a chair
houses a few candles, their wax having dripped languidly down the sides and
onto the surface the candle sits atop.  The walls are etched with a primal,
cave drawing like carving depicting various scenes, one of which is a large
war-form Garou in the midst of a hundred or so figures, each with their own
spiteful halo ringing around their head.  The only thing that could be akin
to a bed is a large collection of furs, sewn together by tough, sinewy
leather and stretched across the room like a hammock.  A few devices of
storage litter the room, an old chest and a dresser line one of the walls. 
The floor is covered in a slightly damn moss, soft to the touch and very
pleasant to walk upon.

`gAn Enormous Willow`n~
Upon a tiny bump of land rising from the swamp-waters stands a truly
massive willow-tree of what must be hundreds of years in age.  Its great
branches extend at least ten yards from the gargantuan trunk, which is
mottled and hoary with great age, but healthy-looking nonetheless.  Curtains
of green, whiplike branches covered with thin leaves hang down all around,
forming a quite secure barrier for the interior about the trunk.  Within
this curtain is what one could almost consider a small house, yet there are
no walls and no floor aside from the hard packed earth.  There are several
little niches in the ground between large roots, and there seems to be a
messy sort of organization to the placement of sticks and rocks about the
place.  Near the edge of the curtain, where a hole exists in the branches
above, there is a circle of fire-blackened stones that have seen recent use,
as well as a pile of small, dry sticks.  A tire swing hangs from the thick
branches.

#gOld courtyard of the Menoit Plantation#n~
Enclosed by an dauntingly immense, antiquated scarlet brick wall with
crumbling grey gargoyles perched in various tense attitudes atop them is a
lengthy driveway, edged on both sides by thick tendrils of slightly
overgrown turquiose green crab grass.  The drive itself is composed of hard
packed soil, rich and black like the majority of fertile earth in New
Orleans; it winds up from the swinging, once-white painted gates toward an
ancient plantation mansion sprawled across the top of a shallow slope.  The
gardens that once surrounded the structure have been lost to disrepair;
their grey and white cobbled walkways covered by fallen and rotting leaves
and petals, their greenery growing wild and uncontrolled into tangled masses
and their accomadating ponds covered by a thick sheen of green slime.  The
mansion itself is an intimidating structure, built high into the skyline
with aging, blackened wood in various sinking spires and a looming
clocktower at the direct center, it's curling, Victorian-era iron hands
pointing to the correct time twice a day.  The solid black, Spanish villa
styled double-doors of the mansion sit nestled back into a darkened stoop at
the top of ten rotting wooden steps, and from the overhang suspends an old
outdoor chandelier in tarnished copper, their cannisters half-filled and
wicks barely managing to dip into the oil.

`rRoom 2A`n~
Two four poster beds in dark, burnished pine sit on opposite sides of
this fair sized room, each bearing double memory-foam mattresses and a
thick, goose-down coverlet folded at the foot.  Heavy, hand-quilted blankets
and sheets of soft, clean cotton have been laden over each bed, both of which
have a polished wooden push stool with two steps to allow for ease in
climbing on.  A thick linen curtain in solid black can be pulled to a close
about the bed, forming a partial canopy to allow for complete privacy while
asleep.  Several cabinets are arranged on one wall, crafted of dark mahogany
with light engravings along the borders of the drawers, likely used for
stowing the personal effects of those who stay here.  The floor is covered
wholly in thick, plush, dark blue carpeting, and the roof is lower than in
the rest of the underground complex, with a very modern, elegant white
ceiling fan attached, providing light to the room from a frosted glass dome
at the center.  A clean kitchenette stocked with modern appliances and a
running sink fills a corner of the room, and another is closed off by thick,
concealing wooden screens, containing a faux-ivory bathtub, shower cubicle,
mirror and toilet.  Similar screens block off portions dedicated for
changing one's clothing in privacy.  A tea table is set in a comfortable
nook, with a pair of chairs on either side, both elegantly crafted of pine
and set with velvet cushions.

#wCelestial Bodies Gentleman#e'#ws Club #e(#wAvg#e.#w NPCs#e:#w 34#e)#n~
Walls draped in thick falls of pure white velvet flank several raised
wooden dais', four levelled, classy marble steps from the floor.  A single,
black leather armless chair occupies a thronelike position on each of the
platforms, the hotseat for private lap dances, at least one of which is
going on at all times the club is open.  The fabric drenched walls encase
the thrumming and din of loud, pulsating music, creating a private world all
it's own.  Speakers dot the ceiling, leading back to a DJ's booth where a
live jockey mans turn-tables round the clock.  A long curving bar with a
polished cherrywood top stretches across the wall that matches the old
fashioned, elegant Parisian doors that open onto Canal Street, and the main
stage lies in a circle at the center of the club, a light dusting of pale
silver glitter ever falling down from an electronic shaker installed into
the ceiling, directly around a tall silver pole that stretches from ceiling
to floor.  The theme is clearly an angelic one, as all the dancers are
dressed in soft hues of white or pale grey, with feathered angel wings
stretching out behind them; even the bases of the private runways are lined
with expensive cotton-replica clouds.  Numerous glass-topped tables in dark
cherry red lie scanttered about the room, with comfortable leather cushioned
booths filling the entirety of one wall, each seating one to four customers.
Waitresses in scant attire wander about the room with cork trays, selling
packs of cigarettes and delivering drinks.

The Cordoba Fish Market~
The smell of fish assaults your nostrils, and as you look around it becomes
clear to you why. The large building is filled with stalls and tables covered in
fish. Heads, tails, filets and almost every fish part concievable are presented
for buyers. This market, which is open all day and night, purchases fish from
the fishermen of Cordoba, dresses them and resells them to the populace. Some
stalls in this building also sell varied vegitables, fruits and meats. The stone
floor is stained with blood and has been worn smooth from the masses that pass
through each day. Several large doors set in the east wall are almost always
open, and lead back to the Cordoba marketplace. A heavy iron bound door is set
in the western wall.

The Fishmarket's Backroom~
This room is small, especially in comparison to the main room of the fish
market. The windowless walls are made of grey stone, as is the ceiling. The
floor is covered in a worn and dirty rug, and the only furniture is a desk and
four wooden chairs. Several certificates from the Cordoba Commision of Weights
and Measures hang on the wall. The thick walls of this room muffle most of the
sounds from the market itself, and the fishy smell is much more faint.

A Hidden Warehouse~
This large room bears the faint smell of fish and sewage. Hundreds of boxes and
crates fill the room, making it difficult to navigate. Through holes in some of
the boxes you can see different goods, some of which have been banned in the
city. Colorful fabrics, hashish and weapons are just some of the goodies found
in this room. You can hear the echoing of footsteps above you, and from time to
time you think you hear them from this room itself. Against the western wall
there is a steel ladder leading up to a heavy trapdoor, and a steel door is set
in the eastern wall.

The sewers of Cordoba~
These large stone tunnels were built long ago during the Roman expansion
into the Iberian lands.  Although no longer used by the majority of the
citizens of Cordoba, these sewers are still pits of human excrement,
garbage, and other unpleasant things which smell disgusting.  The sounds of
water and filth dripping from the walls can be heard all around you, and
their echos make it difficult to determine where sounds originate.  From
time to time you spot massive rats covered in a putrid slime crawl from
beneath debris and into cracks in the tunnel walls.  As you move around you
can't help but get a bit of the same slime that is on the rats on your own
feet.  A heavy steel door is set into the western wall.

Catacombs beneath Cordoba~
These catacombs were probably originally used by the Romans at one point
to bury their dead, but now they lie empty.  Signs of recent expansion are
evident by the coloring of some of the newer tunnels and the remenants of a
few mining tools.  A few places on the walls are streaked with small
rivulettes of water, and dripping can be heard echoing through the
catacombs.  From time to time you also think you hear the echoing of
footsteps, but you can not be sure, as the walls distort almost all sound.

Within a small home~
This small house is almost crowded with furniture, rugs, paintings,
sculptures and the like, although it is not quite tacky.  Several large
plush chairs surround a polished ebon table in the center of the room, with
thick rugs beneath it.  About six other chairs are in various places in this
room, some facing each other, some near other, smaller tables.  A door in
the north wall leads back to the Calle Guadalquivir and an open arch to the
south leads to a kitchen and dining area.

The Dining Area~
This room is somewhat more tastefully appointed than the sitting room,
with only a table, four chairs, a stove and a sink for decoration.  The area
around the stove is in minor disaray, leading you to believe that someone
doesnt always clean up after they use the facilities.  A door in the western
wall and a trapdoor near the sink offer retreat from this room, as does the
arch that leads back into the sitting room.

This root cellar is very cool, excellent for keeping fine wines and
perishable foods.  Several cabinets and wineracks line the walls.  The wine
racks are full of bottles, ranging from three to thirty years old, and the
cabinets are stuffed with food.  The dirt floor is somewhat damp, and you
can see many footprints there.  A wooden staircase before a trap door leads
back to the kitchen.

Entrance, Patio and Dependancies~
You enter a patio with a pink marbled floor and colonades.  An wooden
stair with iron supports leads second floor of this classic villa.  The
center of the patio is decorated by a short fountain and basin.  Small red
fish can be seen swimming in lazy circles within the shallow basin.  Planted
around the fountain are flowers of all colors and several chairs are placed
around the area to allow guests to rest pleasantly.  On a small table there
is a bottle of red wine and "Sangria" bottles.  Beaten copper cups are
provided if you wish to drink.  A door west leads to the dependancies.  A
heavy iron bound door leads south to the Study and the northern door leads
to the Sitting room.  Set into the eastern wall is a heavy iron gate, and
above it is a large sun clock.

dirt packed from countless people walking the ways.  A few doors are seen

night, almost completely pitch.  A bit of trash lingers on the sides, but
not enough to be considered 'dirty' just 'unkept'.

A woodworking shop~
It isn't really a home, it's more of a large workplace for someone who
carves, or someone who holds a long-lasting hatred towards trees.  It's
littered with large and small pieces of light and dark colored woods alike. 
Benches aligning the walls, random tools of the trade hanging everywhere
dangerously.  Chisels strewn about, carving knives stuck in benches and
sharpening stones left on half-finished works.  A small corner of the room
is kept completely clean, everything aligned, and everything known.  A
feminine touch is added as only a loving wife could give.  A single pair of
daggers is set above the door leading to the alleyway, cherry flowers carved
into the ebon hilts.

"De bibliotheca magnificus" as it is inscribed in Latin on the gate and
doorway you see a large structure with Romanesque pillars for support and
granite walls and archways with Moorish designs and architecture, the
windows lining the front of the building have a eastern European monastic
look to them.  The courtyard in front of the building is lined with small
shrubbery and trees to give the building the feeling of life.  The entire
building has a look that gives you the impression of intellectuality.  To
the north is the doorway into the library and to the east and west are the
trees and shrubbery and to the south is Calle Rojo.

with monastic windows giving the room a view to the tree's outside, the
walls occasionally spaced out with torches to give a sense of lighting to
the room, most of the walls are covered in bookshelves with texts ranging
from the Quadrivium and Trivium of Academic studies, Hearth Lore's of
Iberia, the Holy Roman Empire, and The Venetian City States, Biblical Texts
and anything else imaginable.  The rest of the room is scattered with
tables, desks and accompanying chairs with appropriate candelabra, some
tables carrying inkwells and quills, as well as small compartments
containing parchment paper and in some cases papyrus, others much larger and
spaced out to allow study from multiple books.  A door all the way across
the room to the north is locked and marked with the words "Conclave
Occultus" in Latin on the door itself, to the east is a door marked with the
words "Vestibulum" in Latin, to the west is a door marked "Conclave
Pergulas" in Latin and to the south is the door marked "De bibliotheca
magnificus" leading back out to the archway.

This corridor runs adjacent with the windows along the front of the

with torches and candles to light the place at night.  The hallway is
reminiscent of an eastern European monastery with Moorish architecture.  To
the west is a door with the words "Pergulas Quadrivium" in Latin, to the
north a door labeled "Pergulas Trivium" in Latin, to the east is the main
chamber, a small staircase leading up leads to a door way marked with
"Pergulas Academia" in Latin and a stairway leading down with a door reading
"Pergulas Musicus" and a doorway to the east leading back into the main
hall.

Arithmetic, Geometry, Astronomy and Musical Composition.  The room has a
small shelf full of different tools ranging from Abacuses, Map-making
instruments, and algebraic instruments.  Beside the tools are a stack of
wooden boards covered with wax and a few sets of ivory styluses to write on,
the main desk with books and parchments is in front of a large waxen board
and a larger ivory stylus beside it, most of the room has enough space for
every student to sit down at a chair or the floor if need be.  The room is
well lit with torches along the walls.  The door to the east leads into the

with various scrolls and books, and the board is much larger and smoother

built on a small podium of sorts, and most of the students sit on a

your voice across its entirety for speaking practice.  The room is well lit

full of scrolls and parchment which look to have been used a bit.  The whole
room is adorned in various candelabra and a stairway down leads to the hall.

A large courtyard~
This "Vestibulum" is a spacious garden with various spots for seating
during the day to be used by independent students and private teachers, the
courtyard has more than enough tree's and locations for an artist to
practice or paint still lives and a few open area's were some students take
up in amateur fencing.  Most of this area is left unlit with the exception
of a few lanterns left by students.  A path back west leads to the main
chambers.

A private room within the Library~
This is "De Conclave Occultus" of the library, a moderately sized office
with bookshelves lining the walls, most containing books either not found in
the main chamber or records from various businesses.  There is a large desk
with various inkwells, and styluses to write with on the desk as well as
rolls of parchment and leather-bound books that are either half-written in
or blank, a luxurious chair is placed with the desk to give the dimly
candelabra lit room a sense of value.  A statue lies behind the chair that
depicts an angel holding two weighted balance plates in its hands.  A door
to the south leads into the main chamber.

#yEl Mercado de Cordoba#n~
This is Cordoba's marketplace.  The street widens here so that many
merchants can have the room to set up stalls.  Used by day to hold Cordoba's
large markets, merchants come from far and wide to have a chance to hawk
their wares in this large city.  Many of the buildings around here are used
by the city's craftsmen and guilds.

Within a large tent~
You enter a comfortable canvas tent which is guarded by two large nubian
men with scimitars.  The floors of this tent are covered in rich, thick
arabian rugs, and curtains of all colors hang from the walls, hiding the
drab canvas.  A desk of some dark, unknown wood is in the back left corner,
and upon it are a few small locked boxes, ink, paper and a tea service. 
Large pillows upholstered in bright colors are laying on the floor, offering
a comfortable place to lounge.

Catacombs beneath the Library~
These catacombs are built under the library above and as you look around
them you see a style of construction very reminiscent of eastern European
catacombs and even slightly reminiscent of ancient Greek or Carthaginian
structures.  A few torches light this room barely at best.  To the west is a
horridly crumbled down pathway and to the east is a dimly lit hall.

This section of the hall is pitch black and if you feel around you can
sense a lot of rubble around you; apparently this area has collapsed or has
been purposely knocked down, whatever the case may be.  Who knows what is to

A dead end in the Catacombs~
This area is brightly lit compared to the others, and the walls are
covered in random symbols (written in Babel) meaning "Heed these words young
madman, lest ye mind be invaded by powerful forces" If you look towards the
dead end you see a door leading down and against the wall there is a
sculpture built into the wall that resembles a man trying to push his way
out of the wall.  The hallway leads back west.

A sepulchre~
This room is almost a large void of darkness except for a lantern left on
a desk, the lantern shining over various writings and a inkwell with a quill
stylus, a simple chair accompanies the simple desk and if the lantern is
shown around the walls bookshelf upon bookshelf can be seen with various
scriptures and some empty bookshelves can bee seen which seem to be left
over in case more books come in.  To the farther side away from all of the
bookshelves is a coffin built into the floor, the symbols on the coffin read
(in Babel) "Here lays Inuistatio del Cruz, the Befuddled of Salzburg,
Harbinger of Venice."  The doorway upwards leads back into the catacombs.

The atrium of "De domus academia magnificus"~
This is the living quarters for those who study at "De bibliotheca
magnificus" the room is decently decorated with a few bookshelves, most
containing bundled stacks of books belonging to students as well as other
things like walking shoes and canes.  The rest of the room is clad with
Moorish granite archways but the walls are stone and have a simpler look. 
There are a few couches and a chair or two to sit around in, but this room
gets little traffic as it seems.  A stairway upstairs leads to the dormitory
chambers and a doorway to the east leads to a dining room.  A door south
with the words "De domus academia magnificus" labeled on both sides in Latin
is here.

This room serves as the kitchen and dining room of the dormitory, with
the room looking to have been originally just a dining room, but a stone
built division with a little passage way for people to move through was put
in to divide the room.  The kitchen is alive with a roaring fire to keep the
food warm as well as various salted meats, smoked fish and a healthy supply
of vegetables, water, and wine from the "Merus de Vinea Aureum" Or "wine
from the excellent vineyard."  The dining room is well lit with candelabra
and torches, with the table being large and simple, and moderately
confortable chairs.  A doorway north leads back into the Atrium.

Within a cave~
A tunnel leads into a cave of moderate size.  The cave reeks of mustiness
and the damp cold of the underground.  No light enters reaches the depths,
nor do candles or a fireplace shed light on the dark reaches.  If one were
to illumninate this place they would see strange marks and dark green moss
covering the rock walls.  Some tree roots and stalactites jut out from the
ceiling and walls.

This small room is almost completely dark, save for a bit of ambiant
light filtering down from the stair case.  The walls here are formed of
large squared stones fitted tightly together and mortared in place.  The
floor appears to be a single slab of hard stone, perhaps granite, and it
seems to run far beneath the walls.  Drops of water can be heard as water
condenses on the cool stone walls and falls to the hard floor.  Set into the
stone of the southern wall is a massive steel door.

against the walls, and each is filled with books.  A large couch and four
chairs are placed around a rectangular table of stained hardwood.  Set atop
several of the bookcases and in the center of the table are softly glowing
orbs that illuminate the room.  Wide, open doorways lead to the south and

Many tools are scattered about on makeshift tables while only a few are
neatly hung up on the east wall leading to the shop.  A furnace burning huge
logs also sits upon the edge of the east wall, running the full length of
the two storey building.  The smell of the burning wood seemingly present
even if the fire is not.  Three barrels filled to the top with water are
situated between the counter and the furnace.  On the edge of the smithy a
small stable with fresh hay awaits customers horses.

handcrafted tools, weapons and pieces of armor are hung up for display.  The
tools, including pickaxes, scythes with several different blades, sickles,
hammers, pitch forks and random types of sharpened blades are all towards
the back.  Weapons and armor being the prized selection are all on exhibit
just as you come in.  Each piece seeming to be a precisely detailed work of
craftsmanship.  The smell of wood burning makes it way from the door to the
west.  Behind the counter there is a door to the east, labeled Storage: Do
Not Enter.  A set of stairs runs up the south wall leading to a closed
living area.

A small bedroom~
After climbing the stairs a small bedroom opens up.  The first thing
visibly present is the bed placed against the far wall.  The bed is made of
thick and rich mahogany wood.  Sturdy sideboards supporting the mattress
while the underside paneling holding up mattress is marked with a signature
of a budding rose.  The posts on the bed itself are carved wonderfully.  A
long vine branching up the post and across the headboard, leaves hanging and
almost waiting for a breeze to move them.  Periodically, tulips sprout
lovingly over the head board, each of the posts ending in a fully opened
tulip as well.  The foot board is a scene carved wondrously of a small wood
scene and a secret smithy, a young woman working at the bellows.  The detail
is not meticulous, but still wonderful to look at.  Upon the opposite wall,
the furnace from the workshop can vent into the room through a slotted stone
lined fireplace.  A large mirror fills a large portion of the other
non-occupied wall.

In the other corner, several full sized logs have been stacked on top of one
another.

The foyer is circular with a domed ceiling, angelic fresco is painted
between the ribs of molding that meet in the center of the foyer where a
sparkling crystal chandler hangs glistening like a thousand diamonds as day
light dances off it from the arched transom and sidelights around the heavy
oak door.  Large arched doorways open up into the various rooms in the
house.  A grand marble staircase is the focal point of the foyer.  Through
one of the arched doorways is the Parlor.  The plantation shutters are
opened to allow in the light of the moon and display the exquisite condition
of the settees, divans, and fainting couches that are grouped around the
room.  Pineapple shaped tables with square tops dot the room and hold
precious hurricane lamps.  The walls have been painted a soft jade tint.  A
large marble mantle above the fireplace has a Seth Thomas clock upon it. 
The clock is also made of marble, having an iron-winged chariot pulling a
brilliant sun behind it.

A high ceiling with windows and pocket doors which are lined up directly
across from each other on opposite walls to provide natural cross
ventilation.  The moonlight filters in to cast shadows around the room.  The
dining table has on its legs, carved acanthus leaves, a symbol of
immortality.  Beneath the tables is a painted cotton floor cloth done in an
ornate peacock design.  Over the tables is a swinging cypress punkah.  This
device can be manually operated by a house servant utilizing the connecting
cord which creates a nice breeze.  A hand-blown glass flycatcher is located
on the Federal wraparound fireplace mantel.  Syrup or honey is poured inside
and when the attracted flies enter from the roll-lipped bottom, they become
confused and disoriented while attempting to escape.  Next to the fireplace
is a brass plate warmer.  Nearby is a colonial cherry and cypress buffet
with delicate hoof feet.

Moonlight works its way through the trees here, beautiful and tranquil;
this area overlooks an inlet from the bayou.  It seems age has created a
small pond that feeds into a stream on the edge of the property, but the
rest of the area is covered with dense foilage.  The trees here vary, some
seeming to have lived for centuries, others shorter, obviously growing after
the fields stopped being used for harvesting.  The back courtyard of the
manse has several hammocks, a garden and a few fountains that are circled by
freshly cut hedging.  On the shore of the pond is a small raft, obviously
used in the leisure time of those living here.

drapes are gathered at each post of the large bed, large Edwardian style
furniture round out the room with an armoire and two nightstands on either
side of the bed.  In the corner between the French doors and the fireplace
is a small table and two wing back chairs.  A tall beaded shade tiffany
floor lamp stands between the two chairs.  Two hand blown glass hurricane
lamps are placed on the bedside tables all give a relaxing and inviting feel
to the room at night.

Thick Forest~
As you continue through the forest, you see around you many different
kinds of trees and a few different kinds of animal tracks.  Off to the west,
you see a clearing around a very tall, old oak tree.  To the south the
obscure path continues.

A cave-like room.~
This large room has been left undecorated.  Its walls are bare stone,
rough and jagged, and the floor is little more than smooth rock.  Against
the western wall there is a large pile of straw and blankets.  A foul reek
taints the air of this room.

A room in the inn~
This room is quite large by inn lodgings standards.  The reputation for
extravagance is well earned, as these rooms are decorated with the finest
carpets, curtained windows, and furniture.  A large four-poster bed stands
against the far wall, near the window, and has a feather matress and a
pillow, as well as a thick blanket.  Two or three extra pillows have been
piled onto the bed for comfort as well as an extra red dyed blanket across
the foot.  There is a small wooden table with sprawling ink stained maps and
a cluttered pile of unorganized papers covering it, an ink well and quill
standing just off to the side.  Three wooden chairs bank the table though
only one stands free of clutter, showing the occupant does not often
entertain guests.  Moving past the table and chairs, which reside in the
center of the room, you come to a small fireplace.  It's thin wooden mantle
is decorated with weapons of verious types, as if they are put up for
storage.  A dark armoire and a matching writing desk, also scattered with
papers rest not far from the fireplace rounding out the room.  The only
other thing of note and attention in the room is a stout wooden stand made
to hold armor.  Upon it rests a well worn and tended set of chainmail,as
well as an assortment of verious weapons.

A cozy home~
The first thing easily noticed about this extremely small room is that it
is very clean and many candles decorate the whole room.  Placed at random
intervals upon the walls, hanging from the ceiling from lengthy chains and
sitting upon pedestals lining the edge of the room.  There is very little
furniture about, a few chairs and a rug that covers the middle of the floor,
is about it.  Overall for being in the slums, this home looks rather cozy.

Down a staircase~
After pulling up the rug, a small locked trap door leads to a dark
stairwell.  The walls and steps are all cut of stone and small coves are set
within the wall for candles to cast light upon any that might venture down. 
Often the candles are not burning, causing nothing but the cold darkness to
come up from the depth of the stairs.  After reaching the bottom there is a
heavy set iron door with a huge lock upon keeping outsiders away.

Within a Basement~
The smell.  As soon as the iron stairwell door is opened the smell of
decaying flesh spreads out quickly, enveloping anything in its path.  The
room, like the first floor, has candles situated about it casting light upon
the horror that awaits.  The far wall is covered from ceiling to floor in
what at first looks to be a large painting, though upon a closer
observation, matted hair and dark dried blood is what makes up the
masterpiece.  Several lifeless bodies have been posed about a table as if
having a conversation with one another, while a single chair remains empty
at their table.  All upon the floor are claw marks from fingernails and what
looks to be smeared blood that forms a path towards the full wall painting. 
The original start of the path comes from a deep well within the center of
the room.  Upon the top of the well there are more claw marks and bits of
clinging hair around the edges.  Against the east wall there is a large
banner hanging from the ceiling to the floor, upon it is a image of a man
with horns and gigantic wings stretched out from his back.  The banner
ripples every now and then as the cold air circulates about the room.

Passage to the sewers~
Behind the banner there is yet another secret
passageway, though unlike the stairs, it does not have
a single space for candles upon the wall. The passage
is fairly cramped, only about two feet across and any
man of average height would have to duck to walk
within it. At the end of the passage an iron barred
door leads out into what seems to be the sewers of
Cordoba.

The main room of a home~
As the door swings open, the thick smell of burning wood rushes into the
air from inside the main room, eminating from a rather large fiireplace
resessed into the east wall.  Rather low ceilings greet the eye, the walls a
dark colored wood, pieces of rather simple artwork hang from nails all over
the room.  A flat peice of raw wood rests on the floor near to the entrance,
two pairs of shoes resting ontop of it, the wood beneath stained from the
tracking in of snow and rain.  Long counters of wood are secured at waist
level on all open areas of the wall, wax covereing all of them, candles
resting in numerous quanity atop of all of the shelving, each lit with a
small, dancing flame.  A thick woven carpet spans the floor of the room,
dozens of pillows of all sizes and colors strewn about the room.  Full of
warm colors of reds and oranges, dull yellows and greens, make the room
rather welcoming to the eye as well as to the senses.  Two doorways lead to
other areas of the house, one on the west wall, the other resting opposite
of the entrance.

A small room~
Smaller than the main room, this room looks as though it holds a
religious use in it, the same style of wall and carpeting as the previous
room.  Candles are more scarce, and an area in the center of the floor is
surrounded by a circle of at least thirty small, flat stones, each a
different tone of gray.  Scarves of different colors hang from a hook near
the door, and a rather modest alter made out of a single piece of wood sits
ro the right of the enterance.  Two large daggers are stuck point down into
the top of the alter, a delicately handmade whip hanging from the edge of an
irregular alter.

Down the Stairs~
A small wooden staircase, wrapping twice to change directions.  Torches
line the wall, though are not burning, nor do they look like they've seen a
flame in a long time.  The floor is cold and damp, like that of a basement,
a set of wooden double doors at the end of the staircase.  Laying across the
center of the doors is an iron bar, heavy in weight and holding the doors
closed.

A room beyond the stairs~
Darkness was all that could be seen in the room for a moment, but the
thin traces of objects could be sorted through.  With the darkness easily
parted by vampiric eyes, it seemed not as lavish as the rest of the house,
only a few simple peices of furnature around the quarters.  A half empty
bookcase rests against the far wall, the only books on it being written in
Slavic and in need of desperate repare.  The only floor covering in the room
is a very thick woven carpet, set over a six foot by two foot square in the
center of the room.

A small room~
The room is a flourish of color, a small table set against each wall.  On
the tables, the items resting there seemed to be divided in a thoughtful
mannor.  To the right of the door, a table with jewlery and clothing sits,
each item displayed dramaticly with a throw a red material with spider-like
weaving.  Opposite the entrance to the room, a small table sits with a
rather odd shaped piece of silver hung from the wall.  Beneath this mirror,
a bevy of charcoal penicals, liquid rouges, and a nest of hundreds of wooden
and bone beads lay on the table.  The last table seemed to be a small desk,
a quill and ink set out to the top of it, parchment scattered on the surface
and the floor as it bushed off by the wind, though there were no windows in

#cA large scriptorium#n~
This large building is filled almost entirely with large desks of
stained wood.  Straight-backed wooden chairs rest before each of the desks. 
The building smells odd, a mixture of burning tallow from the hundreds of
candles in the room, the ink made from various roots and plants and the dry,
dusty smell of paper.  Scattered over most of the desks are books, papers,
quills and empty inkpots.  A small door leads back onto the street to the
east.
