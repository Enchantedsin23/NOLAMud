 
Hi! I forgot to send this earlier, but my app is done.
I totally know that witchtooth didn't have to be taken literally, but it
appealed to me and so I went for it. One misgiving I have is that she may
not appear brutish/monstrous enough in her history as she will on-grid.
I plan to portray her as living up to her Seeming, especially as she gets
entwined with the politics of whatever Court she finds herself in. Thanks
for the consideration. I am always open for suggestion or making change
if something else would better suit the theme. o/
