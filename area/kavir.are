#eHel#n~
#0The violent twists and turns of the Umbral wastes solidify here.  Like
some great sore upon the madness of the Umbra, a massive pair of brass doors
lie here.  The doors have a massive set of spines reaching out from it to
any who would approach unwanted.  These are the Doors to Hel, Kingdom of the
Daemons.  All who cross these doors are forever damned!  #rTo the south,
lies another pair of gates, no less impressive then that of the ones to Hel.
Here lies the huge Lair of Lilith, Queen of all Daemonkind.  Past these
gates lie the courtyard that stretches all around the impressive Lair of the
Queen.  Two huge minions stand guard at the gates, and watch any who enter
with their baleful, burning gaze.  #n #0Any who enter here, show proper
respect, for the spires rising from the Lair of the Queen are adorned with
the heads of those who dared enter and displease Her, their skulls a warning
to All of the Queen's great power.  #n
