#wHallway in the Mezquita#e - #C(#wHoly Ground#e:#w 2#C)#n~
On either side of this hallway is seen a small door leading into a
priest's private chambers.  The hall is lined with torches fastened to the
walls with dull yet elaborate brass fixtures holding them upright.  The
floor remains bare allowing the hall to echo the footsteps of any who walk
through.  A small table lies next to the larger doors of the kitchen and
hold a candle, an ornate cross and a small basin filled with water.  Placed
inbetween some of the torches lies crosses and other religious statuettes
and artwork attached to the walls.

#wPriest's Room#e - #C(#wHoly Ground#e:#w 2#C)#n~
The priest's room is quite simple to say the least and only four pieces
of furniture are within this room.  A small cot sits pushed into the corner
of the room and a few personal items lie on the blankets from the residing
priest.  Set in the other corner away from the bed is a table and chair,
most contain inkwells, pen and paper for writing and of course any
literature they may be reading.  Finally the last piece of furniture is a
small chest placed at the foot of the bed, a place to put their personal
belongings and clothing.

#yCourtyard of the Calahorra Fort#n~
Just inside the large gates of the Calahorra Fort is its square
courtyard.  Dirt and gravel mostly, this courtyard is used by Cordoba's
troops to train during war time, and house animals and siege weapons during
peace.  Above the walls of the Fort rise ever higher.  Originally used by
the Moors as a checkpoint, it has since provided the conquering Castillian
nobility with a strong base to the south of the city, making a full scale
invasion very difficult.  Some stairs lead up to the gatehouse, while the
bases of two small towers open up to the courtyard north and south, and the
bulk of the fortress begins to the east.

The stone stairs lead up from the courtyard.  There is a wise walkway at
the top of the wall here, a good 30 feet from the ground.  The walkway
continues all the way around the Fort, and the door to the gate house opens
up to the east.

This is the base of the northern tower of the Calahorra Fort.  A table
and some chairs are set up here for soldiers standing guard.  Two narrow
window slits face west and north, the Roman Bridge and the Guadalquivir
river, positioned perfectly for shooting arrows.  A long wooden flight of
stairs leads to the top of the tower.

#yWithin the gatehouse#n~
There are no windows in this small stone structure.  Positioned directly
above the gate, there are wide sliding wooden trapdoors in the floor used
for pouring hot liquids or sand down upon invaders.  Two massive cogwheels
are in this room, one on either far wall, and are manned by four soldiers
who turn the large cranks when the gates are to be opened quickly.

Perhaps 30 feet above the ground, there is a large landing, big enough
for a few people to stand side by side confortably.  From this landing one
is able to step through the stone archway to the north to have access to the
wall that surrounds the Calahorra Fort.  Due to the staircase having no
railings, the Fort has lost some men in the past just due to the long fall
sustained if not paying attention.

#eThe Bawn#g~
The underground tunnels open up into a rather large cavern.  The ceiling
is very high near fifteen feet in height with long thick stalagtites, water
dripping from them, echoing in the distance.  The ground is uneven in many
places, large stalagmites come up from the ground, you having to move your
way through them like a forest.  There are large puddles of stagnant water
pooled on the ground, every bit of rock is slick with water.  There is an
uneasy chill in the air at all times, a feeling of danger and warning fills
the air and your very soul.

#eAssembly Area#g~
Beyond the Bawn another even larger cavern is hollowed out, the highest
point of this massive cavern is near thirty feet, and wide enough to house a
number of families.  There are smaller caves set into the outer walls, some
at floor level, some at higher points in the cave, hand holes dug into the
rockface to access these small caves.  Each cave looks to be a living space,
filled with hay and other personal affects of no special recourse.  At the
very far end of the cavern is another large cave opening shaped in a large
gaping maw.  The room is lit by numerous stone hearths housing large
controlled fires.

#eSpiral Caern Heart#g~
This cavern is smaller then the last though can house a large group of
people.  Its rounded out the walls extremely smooth, the walls slick with a
strange unidentifiable ooze.  In the very center of the cave is a large
stone, rounded into a near perfect sphere.  Upon its surface are strange
arcane writings in a dark bile like color.  The sphere itself is also
covered in a strange ooze like substance.  At all times the ooze upon all
the surfaces seems to move, at times, a face can be seen within the
substance, dark whispers always heard though none comprehensible.

The clearing expands out more, larger in fact though the trees above
begin to form over the area producing a thick canopy.  The air itself is one
of reassurance, a feeling of strength and near vitality.  There are numerous
signs of life here, small forest animal's scamper through, mostly field mice
being so close to the village itself.

In the Courtyard~
A large iron gate with the initial 'N' on the left and the initial 'M' on
the right serves as an entrance to this wondrous courtyard.  A path made of
large stepping-stones fitted together runs between the front door and the
street.  About midway along the path it circles both sides of a large
fountain made of granite.  The fountain is of a large dragon with outspread
wings and its head lifted toward the sky, from which issues a steady flow of
water to run down into the pool below.  The dragon's tail serves as the base
of the fountain, which is roughly ten feet in diameter.  Spreading out from
both sides of the path is a lush green lawn with many small gardens of
flowers.  The large estate is surrounded on all sides by a wide breezeway,
which is reached by climbing three steps.  Two large oak doors with bronze
knockers emblazed with the same initials as the gate stand ready to allow

#CMeeting Area#g~
In front of a large house made of a combination of wood and stone lies a
large ring of stones where inside a fire is lit on nights of meetings and
moots of all kinds.  Outside the large circle of stones are large logs so
some may sit comfortably.

The Foyer~
Tall pillars hold the ceiling far above your head in this foyer.  A Black
marble floor spreads out in many directions.  On the right side of the room
as you enter the front door is a broad archway leading into the sitting
room, used to entertain guests.  To the left is a large wooden door leading
to the study and across from the entrance is a wide staircase leading to the
upper floor.  Beautiful tapestries hang on the walls beside paintings of
many individuals, presumably family members.  Just behind the stairway
stands a plain wooden door, likely leading to the kitchens from the aromas
which come from that direction.

#CAssembly Area#g~
The bawn opens up to the Caern assembly area where the occupants of the
Caern itself can live if they choose and settle to meet with each other. 
The area itself is very open unlike the bawn, there being no canopy to block
the sky above so the moon can shine down upon all its occupants.

The Sitting Room~
Several couches form a square in the middle of the room with a large
square oak table situated in the middle.  The table is very low to the
ground serving as a place to set drinks and perhaps hors d'oeuvres.  Around
the walls are paintings, including many landscapes with a portrait here and
there, some exotic in nature, of far away places and people.  A large
fireplace sits to one side of the room keeping it warm.  The mantle displays
several stuffed birds of prey, and even a beautiful snow white owl.  Above
the mantle a crest hangs with two swords crossed behind it.  On the shield
of the crest is a large dragon holding in its claws a three masted ship.

The Study~
A beautiful oak desk sits to the back of the room in front of a small
fireplace.  The desk is neatly organized and completely lacking in clutter. 
On the desk sits a small inkwell, an ivory cup with several quills, a stack
of writing paper, a blotter, and a small wooden dispatch box which is
securely locked.  In front of the desk are two comfortable looking chairs,
with one high-backed chair behind it.  The walls are covered with bookcases
containing countless volumes of text on a wide variety of subjects.  Above
the fireplace hangs a single tall painting of a woman with dark hair and
eyes.  She is frail and seems to have managed only a weak smile for the
artist.  She holds in her hand a white handkerchief, folded in her lap.

The Master Bedroom~
Easily the largest room in the house the Master Bedroom is surprising
sparse in its furnishings.  Large curtains hang on three walls but if
opened, reveal no windows behind, as if they are merely another decoration. 
A large bed sits against the back wall large enough to easily hold eight or
ten people, with thick satin comforters and many down pillows.  Black gauzy
curtains surround the bed, hung from a brass rod set into the wall.  A door
on one side of the room leads to a large walk-in closet filled with fine
garments and a dressing table sits outside it, oddly enough without a
mirror.  Large area rugs cover nearly every square inch of the floor.  The
walls are set with several small scones holding oil lamps, which provide
just enough light to see by, but barely manage to illuminate the room at
all.

The Kitchen~
Several staff members hurry about preparing food for guests and
themselves.  Rushing through one door or another they set off in search of
some cleaning that needs done.  A long row of sinks sits along one wall and
opposite that is a large hearth used for cooking and keeping the room warm. 
A small archway leads into a sleeping area and from here a trap door leads
to the wine and root cellar.  Several shelves and cabinets line the other
walls holding spices, and ingredients used for preparing meals.  Several
wheels of cheese hang from a rope on one of the shelves beside several
cloves of garlic and some thyme.

#RA Large House - Caern Heart#g~
Within a large newly constructed house lies the very heart of the Caern. 
The house is about two stories in height with a roof made of hay and straw,
the center of the roof is left open to the sky above.  There is no second
floor everything is wide open, the ceiling held up by rafters.  The ground
is dirt beaten down very hard.  The very center of the home there is a
single tree that grows tall.  The leaves are always in full bloom nice and
green even in the winter months, the trunk is very strong.  A strange
feeling can be felt coming closer to this massive tree within.  Around the
tree like the outside, are a few large logs set around for seating if need
be.

The air down here is cool and smells of damp earth.  Several racks line
the walls with countless bottles of wine in a variety of types and years. 
Several ale kegs sit just to the right of the stairs ready to entertain
guests at a moments notice.  A variety of foodstuffs sit on shelves, left
here so that they stay fresh in the cool air.  The floor is covered in
straw, which is changed on a weekly basis to draw moisture out of the air
and prevent mildew.

Here under a small canopy of trees lies a shrine dedicated to the spirit
who helped purify and fortify the spiritual strength of this area, the great
Cockroach Spirit.  In the center of the clearing lies in a circle of stones
refuse from the neareby village where you can see live cockroaches festeirng
within feeding on the refuse itself.  You can feel the spiritual energy
within.

Entryway~
Guarded by heavy, wooden doors, this room is rather sparse, lacking any
sort of decoration beyond several oil lamps providing adequate lighting.  To
the west and north, there are two more heavy wooden doors, each with a
sliding-bar lock, but on the exterior.  Signs above both doors are inscribed
with both Latin and Spanish, saying "Holding Area".  To the east is an open
doorway leading into the indicated "Purchases and Inquiries".  A narrow
stairwell leads upwards, but is barred by a rope from which a wooden sign
bearing the universal "X" of no admittance is hanging.

This room contains several shuttered windows, allowing ample light and

order.  Along the walls are multiple bunks, however, perhaps a dozen in all.
Some of them are occupied by poorly dressed men, some are not.  The room is
not quiet, however, and most of the occupants seem to be engaged in various
games of dice and whatnot on the well-kept floor, keeping the noise to a
soft din.

Through a wide passageway the office is reached, where all of this
business' affairs are conducted.  There is a large, wooden desk occupied by
an inkwell and quill pen, as well as a few sheets of parchment.  Behind the
desk are a scroll-rack laden with scrolls and a small case with a few books.
Looking at the titles, they are obviously ledgers and other such books
outlining transactions and other records necessary for the efficient
operation of this business.  Dangling near the wall beside the desk is a
rope leading up through a hole in the ceiling.  The note "Ring for Service"
is tacked onto the desk below it.

Up through the narrow stairs a modest bedroom can be found occupied only
by a bed, a locked chest, and a small desk for furnishings.  The walls
contain a few various (and small) maps and various doodlings, but little
else.  The bed is covered in a strange fashion, certainly not in the style
of Spain.  A small chest lies in a small recess in the wall near the desk,
decorated with a style reminiscent of Byzantium or Greece.  The desk itself
is much smaller than its downstairs counterpart, and bears only a small
inkpot and pen.  Several shuttered windows can be opened to look out upon
the street to the south.

A large, fenced courtyard stretches out here, offering the O'Finnigan
Estate some degree of separation from Cordoba proper.  There is a
cobblestone walkway that leads to the front doors of the house, flanked on
either side by a row of hedges, trimmed to about waist height.  The house
itself is on the larger side, but is mostly one-story, with the only
vertical extension being directly centred in the front of the building. 
There are windows throughout the house, with the ones on the second floor
being made of glass.

A long and wide entrance hall opens here, with exits stretching off in
each direction.  Along one wall is a large portrait of Sheamus, and along
the opposite is a mirror for guests to use.  There is a fine red carpet on
the ground.  Off to one side, a staircase leads up to a pair of double
doors, bearing Sheamus' personal crest on the centre.  The handrails are
ornately carved, one ending in the form of an eagle, the other a lion. 
Built into the side of the staircase is another door, leading to a further
staircase to the basement.  A large chandelier hangs from the ceiling in the
centre of the hall.

from the courtyard, which has two large windows and between them, a large
painting of a beautiful seaside cliff.  Opposite the painting, there is a
large fireplace built between bookcases.  The room is furnished with about
half a dozen cosy armchairs and a fairly large table in the centre.

A large banquet hall stretches out here.  The single largest feature is
the grand table, which seems to have more seats than could possibly be used.
The chairs are wooden, carved simply, with a small cushion on each of them,
except for the one at the head and the ones to either side of it, which are
ornately carved and covered in velvet.  The lighting comes from a chandelier
hanging in the centre of the room, and small torch holders in between the
windows.  Each of the sidewalls is lined with windows.  Along the back wall,
there is a fireplace.  Next to the fireplace is a door leading off to the
kitchen and the servants' chambers.

being so close to the village itself.

The master bedroom of the O'Finnigan Estate~
Two grand, ornately carved wooden doors open up into the large bedroom of
the Estate.  The primary fixture is the large four-post bed that takes up
almost an entire wall, with pillows encased in silk and blankets of soft
down.  Overlooking the courtyard is a number of glass windows, creating a
clear view of the courtyard and the town beyond when the drapes are tied
back.  There are thick, elegant crimson drapes with gold lining over the
windows.  The carpeting in this room is soft and plush, and a deep shade of
crimson.  There is a set of double doors leading out to a balcony, which
overlooks the back of the grounds.  There are twin armchairs on the balcony,
fairly comfortable.  Inside the room, there is a large fireplace, and two
large, cushioned armchairs beside it.  Between the chairs there is a small
table, with a pair of wine glasses and a bottle of wine on it.

The basement of the Estate is taken up as a wine cellar.  The occasional
cobweb hangs in the corner, but the distinguishing features of this room are
the rows and rows of wines, some exotic and some quite old, that line the
shelves around and in the room.  Along one wall is a grand set of double
doors, with a guard standing on either side.

The grand doors open into a large, windowless, candlelit ballroom, much
like the one upstairs only without the windows.  The floor is the same
smooth wood, and there is a large stage along the far wall.  The walls are
rough stone, with occasional pillars carved out of them.  Every so often
there is a small torch holder to provide light, the rest of which comes from
the many small chandeliers hanging from the ceilings.  At the back of the
stage, off to one side, is a large door, with a guard standing at either
side.

The door opens into a nice sized meeting room, perhaps the size of a
small tavern.  It has much the feel of an Elysium, with a number of cosy,
padded armchairs, only a few candles along the walls to provide light, and a
number of small tables.  One wall is taken up entirely with bookcases, which
contain many curious readings but even more trinkets of mild interest.  Like
the ballroom, the walls are carved roughly of the local stone.

Before the Gates of Seville~
The tall gates of Seville stand directly before the road here.  They loom
up, a combination of iron bars and a thick wooden door, the gates are wide
enough to allow several carts to pass side by side.  The gate opens up into
the great city of Seville to the west, while the road heads east and winds
off somewhere else.

#eA Small Home#n ~
The first thing easily noticed about this extremely small room is that it
is very clean, with several small lanterns placed at random intervals upon
the walls, hanging from the ceiling from lengthy chains, giving off a faint
glow throughout the room.  There is very little furniture about, a few
chairs and a rug that covers the middle of the floor, is about it.  A small
closed off stairwell leads downstairs, a few lanterns in the stairwell also
gives off a dim light for people to see where they are going.

#eThe Temple#n ~
This room is broken down into two separate sections.  Two separate
chambers, the inner chamber which is the furthest back and the outer chamber
which seems to be the largest area of gathering, are separated by an archway
with carved Egyptian designs upon it.  At a closer look upon the archway,
various creatures like hawks, cats, beetles, scorpions and snakes can be
seen within the elaborate design.  Several rows of wooden benches are lined
up in front of the main altar.  Hieroglyphs decorate the altar and the
various pots and clay urns situated on top of the center of worship.

The Sewers of Cordoba~
These large stone tunnels were built long ago during the Roman expansion
into the Iberian lands.  Although no longer used by the majority of the
citizens of Cordoba, these sewers are still pits of human excrement,
garbage, and other unpleasant things which smell disgusting.  The sounds of
water and filth dripping from the walls can be heard all around you, and
their echos make it difficult to determine where sounds originate.  From
time to time you spot massive rats covered in a putrid slime crawl from
beneath debris and into cracks in the tunnel walls.  As you move around you
can't help but get a bit of the same slime that is on the rats on your own
feet.

beneath debris and into cracks in the tunnel walls.  As you move around you
can't help but get a bit of the same slime that is on the rats on your own
feet.

The Sewers of Cordoba~
These large stone tunnels were built long ago during the Roman expansion
into the Iberian lands.  Although no longer used by the majority of the
citizens of Cordoba, these sewers are still pits of human excrement,
garbage, and other unpleasant things which smell disgusting.  The sounds of
water and filth dripping from the walls can be heard all around you, and
their echos make it difficult to determine where sounds originate.  From
time to time you spot massive rats covered in a putrid slime crawl from
beneath debris and into cracks in the tunnel walls.  As you move around you
can't help but get a bit of the same slime that is on the rats on your own
feet.  The tunnel sticks out just far enough to climb up to the docks above,
or one can follow the runoff right into the river to the south.

#wPriest's Room#e - #C(#wHoly Ground#e:#w 2#C)#n~
The priest's room is quite simple to say the least and only four pieces
of furniture are within this room.  A small cot sits pushed into the corner
of the room and a few personal items lie on the blankets from the residing
priest.  Set in the other corner away from the bed is a table and chair,
most contain inkwells, pen and paper for writing and of course any
literature they may be reading.  Finally the last piece of furniture is a
small chest placed at the foot of the bed, a place to put their personal
belongings and clothing.

On either side of this hallway is seen a small door leading into a
priest's private chambers.  The hall is lined with torches fastened to the
walls with dull yet elaborate brass fixtures holding them upright.  The
floor remains bare allowing the hall to echo the footsteps of any who walk
through.  A small table lies next to the larger doors of the kitchen and
hold a candle, an ornate cross and a small basin filled with water.  Placed
inbetween some of the torches lies crosses and other religious statuettes
and artwork attached to the walls.

#wKitchen#e - #C(#wHoly Ground#e:#w 1#C)#n~
Two small oaken doors open up to reveal a modest kitchen complete with a
larger rectangular table; chairs line either side of the long table giving
ample room to seat all of the residing priests at once.  At the heads of the
table, the chairs look to be made of a better quality wood and the
decorations are faint but still over done compared with the other seats. 
The rest of the actual kitchen area sports a chimney that's main job is to
remove the smoke from the logs that burn underneth any resting kettle of
soup or broth.  A small cupboard also is in the kitchen and contains
silverware, cooking and eating utensils.  Next to the cupboard lying on a
small table is a water pitcher and basin for washing up before eating.

This room is dark and damp used as more of a storage facility than
anything else of importance.  A rack full of ceremonial wine lies on the
eastern wall, some of the vintages look to be very old and are covered in
dust.  In the other coverns of the room lie piles of stored goods; broken
artifacts needing repair and old paintings lean against those walls. 
Torches are sparcely lined on the walls and a few harmless mice scurry about
the floor every now and then.

front of the room, less ornate but still of God's work.  Few priests meander
back and forth within the room simply there for anyone's spiritual needs or
those wanting guidance or support.

This basement of sorts has led into the subterrainan catacombs of the
church.  The most influencial priests and monks were buried in these walls
and their tombs lie directly into the walls stacked on top of one another. 
It seems a bit errie and holds an almost ghostly atmosphere but right above
is the house of god.  No harm should come to any down here and those buried
here should rest in peace eternally.

and leaves several places for the next deaths in line.  A large grate drains
down into the sewers.

This is a short hallway obviously intended as a brief connector between
the Guadalquivir street, and the main room of the brothel.  A pair of thick
doors lie to the south blocking off the view of the street, and to the north
another pair of thick doors connect to the common room of the brothel.  On
the east side of the hallway is an alcove with which a guard might observe
those entering and leaving.

and reclining chairs have been placed with which people can relax upon.  The
floor has been covered in carpeting, and tapestries have been placed upon
the walls, upon the eastern side of the room rests a bar in which spirits
are served.  There are three exits from the room, a pair of heavy doors to
the south which appear to be the main entrance of the Brothel and a set of
stairs lead upwards to a second floor, finally upon the northern portion of
the room is a door set discreetly to one side.

This is a room little larger than many bedrooms, however it appears to
serve as a private salon of some sort.  A reclining couch which is in much
better condition than the ones in the common room rest to one side as well
as a small table with writing instruments upon it.  A cabinet lies to the
north and appears to contain spirits.  The walls of this room are adorned
pleasantly with curtains and it possesses the cleaned nightly look present
elsewhere in the brothel.

A Small Bedroom in the Crescent Rose~
This room within the brothel Guadalquivir seems to serve an obvious
purpose in providing a place for the establishment to do business; there is
a bed along one wall of the room and a dresser along the opposite wall. 
About the room are things a woman might use to clean herself up as well as
make herself presentable, as which much of the rest of the establishment the
room shows signs of being cleaned frequently.  The room has a single exit
leading out into the hallway as well as a window covered in a heavy curtain.

#gA small ill-beaten path within the thicket#n~
A diminutive trail leads curving between large trees and the occasion
over-sized rock.  The path itself appears to be trodden down merely by the
passing of a carriage not to long ago.  Looming treetops present an outright
murky presence to the area and a shrill sound when the wind howls just so. 
Along with these shadows there is a bone chilling cold gathering within the
brush, clinging to the trees and the area's periphery.  The north holds the
trail away from this thicket while the south is a dark gloomy degree of
foliage.

A brutal degree of trees, vines, and an assortment of various other

south there appears to be a large carriage its paint thinning with age,
surrounded by the ill-natured growth of the plants that reside here.

forming large geometric colored shapes and designs.

The soft scent of orange blossums seem to linger in here as it clings to
any who walk by.  This common area is frequented by those coming in and out
for education or to simply glance at the beautiful architecture of this
place.  A large mosaic of cut tiles lies in the center of the room showing a
large natural figure complete with orange trees and several animals all in
different colors, certainly a sight to behold.  To the north and south lie
the books being held in this place and east are a few seating areas for
comfort and privacy.

merely set here for simplicity purposes.  Several tables have been set up
along with chairs and a few long benches are here as well giving plenty of
room for those who wish to study.  It also has a small section for any
'classes' that wish to be held here and those chairs are pushed off to the
side to keep from the general populas not wanting to disturb them of course.

fact of its secrecy.  It of course sports more of the special tomes, scrolls
and books not held within the other parts of the university.  Those wishing
for a more private place of study come here if they are fortunate to know of
its existance.  And still others utilize this room for the learning of
topics that might be less common outside of these walls.

The Cordoba Fish Market~
The smell of fish assaults your nostrils, and as you look around it becomes
clear to you why. The large building is filled with stalls and tables covered in
fish. Heads, tails, filets and almost every fish part concievable are presented
for buyers. This market, which is open all day and night, purchases fish from
the fishermen of Cordoba, dresses them and resells them to the populace. Some
stalls in this building also sell varied vegitables, fruits and meats. The stone
floor is stained with blood and has been worn smooth from the masses that pass
through each day. Several large doors set in the east wall are almost always
open, and lead back to the Cordoba marketplace. A heavy iron bound door is set
in the western wall.

The Fishmarket's Backroom~
This room is small, especially in comparison to the main room of the fish
market. The windowless walls are made of grey stone, as is the ceiling. The
floor is covered in a worn and dirty rug, and the only furniture is a desk and
four wooden chairs. Several certificates from the Cordoba Commision of Weights
and Measures hang on the wall. The thick walls of this room muffle most of the
sounds from the market itself, and the fishy smell is much more faint.

A Hidden Warehouse~
This large room bears the faint smell of fish and sewage. Hundreds of boxes and
crates fill the room, making it difficult to navigate. Through holes in some of
the boxes you can see different goods, some of which have been banned in the
city. Colorful fabrics, hashish and weapons are just some of the goodies found
in this room. You can hear the echoing of footsteps above you, and from time to
time you think you hear them from this room itself. Against the western wall
there is a steel ladder leading up to a heavy trapdoor, and a steel door is set
in the eastern wall.

The Sewers of Cordoba~
These large stone tunnels were built long ago during the Roman expansion
into the Iberian lands.  Although no longer used by the majority of the
citizens of Cordoba, these sewers are still pits of human excrement,
garbage, and other unpleasant things which smell disgusting.  The sounds of
water and filth dripping from the walls can be heard all around you, and
their echos make it difficult to determine where sounds originate.  From
time to time you spot massive rats covered in a putrid slime crawl from
beneath debris and into cracks in the tunnel walls.  As you move around you
can't help but get a bit of the same slime that is on the rats on your own
feet.  A heavy steel door is set into the western wall.

Catacombs beneath Cordoba~
These catacombs were probably originally used by the Romans at one point
to bury their dead, but now they lie empty.  Signs of recent expansion are
evident by the coloring of some of the newer tunnels and the remenants of a
few mining tools.  A few places on the walls are streaked with small
rivulettes of water, and dripping can be heard echoing through the
catacombs.  From time to time you also think you hear the echoing of
footsteps, but you can not be sure, as the walls distort almost all sound.

La Taberna del Cazador Borracho~
A popular place for a number of residents in the area, the Taberna del
Cazador Borracho offers a public place that is easy to blend in to, and
suitable for your drinking and eating needs.  There is a bar along the east
wall of this room where drinks are served.  A server can be seen darting to
and from the doors behind the bar in the northeast corner of the room that
lead to the kitchen.  A few tables and chairs are placed in this room and
people can be seen conversing, drinking, and playing card games and the like
all around.  To the north of here is the common room where you can be seated
to eat or drink your fill.

You are in the common room of the Taberna del Cazador Borracho.  The
scene is dominated by a large fireplace and a number of sturdy tables and
chairs are set up around the room.  The floor here is tiled with an
attractive sand colored tile.  This place appears to be quite busy most of
the time because of its prime location, and many people can be seen entering
and leaving in a fairly short time.  The arched opening to the south leads
to the bar, and appears to be the only exit as this room stretches the
length of the building.

The kitchen holds most of the food products that the taberna uses, as
well as a couple of servers not doing any particular job, and a number of
stoves for cooking stews, meats, breads, and all the rest.  The smell of
fresh meats, vegetables and spices fills the air in here with a hearty,
pleasant aroma.  There is a stairway in the southwest corner of the room
leading up, as well as a trapdoor at its base leading to a storage
crawlspace.  There is a door to the east leading to the back of the taberna
on to a small patio.  To the west are the double doors leading to the bar
room.

Within a small home~
This small house is almost crowded with furniture, rugs, paintings,

plush chairs surround a polished ebon table in the center of the room, with
thick rugs beneath it.  About six other chairs are in various places in this
room, some facing each other, some near other, smaller tables.  A door in
the north wall leads back to the Calle Guadalquivir and an open arch to the
south leads to a kitchen and dining area.

A Large Tiled Floor Bedroom~
This room is quite large and appears to fill nearly half the size of this
two tiered building.  There is a door to the east leading to a second floor
garden and patio with a fair view of some of the rooftops and other nearby
buildings.  The floors are tiled with large dark marbled tiles.  Towards the
east half of the room, the tiles stop at a large mosaic of many colors in an
attractive pattern that follows the shape of the room.  The high ceilings
are nearly met by the large four post bed sitting at the center of the north
wall.  A few cabinets, tables and a couple of couches are in this room, as
well as a variety of plants from this region.  The chimney from the
fireplace rises through the center of the floor.  The sand colored plaster
walls reflect the light of the candles and lamps set into them.  The noise
from the tavern below can barely be heard through the thick floors; it is
almost overpowered by the dull noise made by the fire in the chimney at some
times.

The Dining Area~
This room is somewhat more tastefully appointed than the sitting room,
with only a table, four chairs, a stove and a sink for decoration.  The area
around the stove is in minor disaray, leading you to believe that someone
doesnt always clean up after they use the facilities.  A door in the western
wall and a trapdoor near the sink offer retreat from this room, as does the
arch that leads back into the sitting room.

This is the patio just above what is currently the east end of the
kitchen.  The 2nd floor is now visible as slightly smaller than the 1st on
the east end of the building as well as the west, leaving space for the
taverns signs in front, and for this patio out back.  Over the edge of the
patio a ground level patio and the door to the kitchen can be seen.  There
is a small garden here which is left empty during the winter months.  Four
comfortable chairs are here as well, offering a seat with a view of the
night sky and some nearby buildings.  A small marble-like knee level fence
made from the same plaster as the building surrounds the patio on all three
sides.  A large archway and door lead to the bedroom to the west.

illuminate the room when needed.  A large bed dominates the room.  It is

This root cellar is very cool, excellent for keeping fine wines and
perishable foods.  Several cabinets and wineracks line the walls.  The wine
racks are full of bottles, ranging from three to thirty years old, and the
cabinets are stuffed with food.  The dirt floor is somewhat damp, and you
can see many footprints there.  A wooden staircase before a trap door leads
back to the kitchen.

#pInside the yard of a Monastery#n~
The yard is a quiet place with only the sounds of the occasional animal. 
A few goats stroll around eating usually whatever they can find.  Here and
there a chicken clucks or scratches the ground looking for something to eat.
This area is mainly just grass for the animals to graze on.  Over to the
southwest is a small vegetable garden and to the north is a small barn. 
Many paths worn into the grass by the monks who care for this Monastery lead
off in several directions.

A small barn used to store tools and sometimes hay or other feed for the
animals, stands here.  The door seems to be in disrepair and has been
removed from its hinges.  It stands leaning against the wall of the barn.  A
short ramp leads into the interior of the building.  Over to the west stands
another long building, probably stables for horses as the soft sound of the
occasional whiney can be heard.  A foot path worn by constant use heads both
west and to the south.

The stables stand here taking up quite a bit of room.  They reach all the
way nearly flush with the far western wall.  Combined with the barn the two
buildings make an effective barrier against the harsh north wind.  Two
entrances allow both incoming and outgoing traffic to move unimpeded.  Short
ramps lead up inside the stables making it easier to move the horses in and
out.  A worn wooden weather vane spins silently in the breeze blowing above
the stables.  The horses inside seem to be aware of your presense and a few
of them snort or whiney making their discomfort known.  A worn foot path
leads to the west and the east.

The Antechamber~
Upon entrance there is a small, somewhat dank, antechamber.  The walls
are made of brick and small alcoves hold candles.  As the walls climb the
ceiling curves in and becomes domed.  A few faded tapistries depicting
religious scenes hang on the walls.  Small redwood benches adorn either side
of the room.  A small table sits on each side of each bench with a beautiful
glass vase, holding a single black orchid.  There is an empty inlet close to
the door leading outside, with brass hooks to hold a wet cloak or store
boots, though it looks quite barren.  Two doors to the north lead into the
common room of the house.

The other entrance for the stables is here, a bit of mud has dried on the
ramp leading inside.  This door seems to be more of an exit however than an
entrance as most of the tracks in the dirt from the horses are leading away.
The stables seem very well constructed and clearly taken care of from the
few repairs which can be seen.  Towards the west, outside the wall a small
graveyard can be seen surrounded by another small stone wall.  A dirt foot
path leads to the east and south from here.

The Common Room~
The common room is where those, the mistress of the house deems worthy of
her time, invites to meet and talk with.  The flooring is hardwood, with an
imported rug from the orient in its center.  Couches and chairs of matching
upholstering are in a horseshoe shape around the outter edge of the rug to
face a beautiful fireplace, roaring with a warm fire.  The fireplace is made
of a rose marble, carved into it is intricately designed flowers.  A black
metal screen rests before the fire so no hot ash escapes to set the house
aflame.  There are four tall thin windows, allowing light to pass into the
room.  Plants in ceramic holders soak up all the light possible during the
day, their leaves a bright green.  Candles scented of a light vanilla are
sporatically sat about in aesthetic silver candle holders.  The southern
door leads to the antichamber, while the door to the east leads outside to
the garden.  Gazing to the west one can see the dining area and to the north
there is a long hallway.

Consisting of mainly grass and a few paths, this area doesn't seem to get
much use.  Even the paths worn through the grass have begun to grow over
from lack of use.  A small gate, much like the one you used to enter the
yard originally, hangs here keeping animals from wandering off.  A small
cemetary can be seen only a few hundred feet outside the gate.  One foot
path leads to a back door in the Monastery building itself.  Another leads
off to the south.

A Long Hallway~
Beyond the double doors, lies a long hallway, any noise seeming to echo
off the stone walls.  Hardwood floors creak in some spots when tread upon,
even with the sapphire colored stretch of carpet toward the middle of the
hall to cushion ones steps.  Hissing torches are lit every few feet to light
the hallway superbly.  Above each torch, the wall is blackened from the
flickering flames.  Newer looking tapistries, rich with color line the
walls, illustrates dancing and singing.  The southern end of the hallway
leads back to the common room, while the northern end leads to elegant
double doors.  There is an western door before the end of the hall, a lily
carved into the door.

building.  A cemetery can just be made out off to the west.  High above you
rises the bell tower of the Monastery.  From here you can just make out what
looks like a bird's nest built where the tower meets the rest of the roof. 
Apparently people aren't the only ones who enjoy God's house.

In a Flower Garden~
A twisting and turning pathway leads around a plethora of exotic and
common flowers and twisted vines.  A large weeping willow tree stands tall
in the center of the garden, it's long, flimsy branches swaying gently in
the lightest of breeze.  A finely crafted wooden bench rests beneath the
willow tree, planeted firmly in the ground.  A small gazebo is near the edge
of the property, with a small table within.  A few unlit lanterns hang
within the gazebo for lighting at night.  Crickets chirp merrily in the
foliage; while fireflies flicker about, their soft light pulsating.  A door
leads back into the house to the west.

An alley off the Calle Guadalquivir~
Passing near a stone archway, a small and dimly lit passage is seen.  The
dirt packed from countless people walking the ways.  A few doors are seen
along the sides of the buildings, the alleyway continuing a ways down, at
night, almost completely pitch.  A bit of trash lingers on the sides, but
not enough to be considered 'dirty' just 'unkept'.

Dining Room~
Upon stepping into the dining area the eye immediatly is drawn to a long
wooden table.  An intricate, cream colored lace covers the redwood table. 
Fine china the color of cobalt blue, trimmed in silver and gleaming
silverware sits before each of the ten spaced out, softly cushioned, high
backed chairs that were upholstered to match the color of the tablecloth. 
Crystal wine glasses are turned upside down when not in use, sitting on a
folded deep blue cotton napkin.  The centerpiece is of a colorful assortment
of freshly-cut flowers, accented with fern and babys breath sitting in a
silver vase, intricately designed.  There is but one tapistry in the room
and that is an artists portrayl of Jesus' last supper.  A swinging door to
the west leads to the kitchen, while to the east is the common room.

A woodworking shop~
It isn't really a home, it's more of a large workplace for someone who
carves, or someone who holds a long-lasting hatred towards trees.  It's
littered with large and small pieces of light and dark colored woods alike. 
Benches aligning the walls, random tools of the trade hanging everywhere
dangerously.  Chisels strewn about, carving knives stuck in benches and
sharpening stones left on half-finished works.  A small corner of the room
is kept completely clean, everything aligned, and everything known.  A
feminine touch is added as only a loving wife could give.  A single pair of
daggers is set above the door leading to the alleyway, cherry flowers carved
into the ebon hilts.

#pThe south side of the yard#n~
Stretching out before you is a beautiful vegetable garden.  Many types
and varieties of vegetables have been planted.  The garden looks well cared
for and is completely free of any kind of weed or grass.  A fairly sturdy
stick fence surrounds the garden to keep the animals from eating the
vegitables.  A path leads from the small gate to the garden straight up
toward the church building where a side door can be seen.  Another foot path
continues west toward the back wall of the yard.

A Bedroom~
Upon entrance of these large room, the light aroma of vanilla fills your
olfactory senses.  A large canopied bed sits between two bay windows.  Each
window has cobalt blue curtains handing from silver hooks on a wooden rod. 
A rope, dyed a cerulean blue hangs to the side of the curtain to open and
close them.  There are soft cushions the color of the rope, on each window
sill.  A matress filled with soft down feathers lay upon the oaken bed
frame.  Heavy blankets the hue of royal blue are folded down with pillows
comfortably thrown about the bed.  Silky white rose petals are sprinkled on
the comforter, a light scent from them.  A tall bookshelf stands tall,
filled with leatherbound books and rolled up scrolls.  An oaken desk sits
close to the bookshelf with fine parchment scribbled upon with rushed
strokes of a quill pen laying close by.  She has an oaken armoire, filled
with fine clothes.  A few oil paintings are hung on the walls in elegent
frames.  Freestanding mirrors are placed around the room sporatically.  A
brick fireplace always has a high flame radiating light and heat.  A western
door leads to the bath and the southern doors lead back into the hallway.

Archway into "De bibliotheca magnificus"~
As you stand in front of the gated entrance with an overlying archway to
"De bibliotheca magnificus" as it is inscribed in Latin on the gate and
doorway you see a large structure with Romanesque pillars for support and
granite walls and archways with Moorish designs and architecture, the
windows lining the front of the building have a eastern European monastic
look to them.  The courtyard in front of the building is lined with small
shrubbery and trees to give the building the feeling of life.  The entire
building has a look that gives you the impression of intellectuality.  To
the north is the doorway into the library and to the east and west are the
trees and shrubbery and to the south is Calle Rojo.

#pThe southeast corner of the yard#n~
More grass grows here for the animals to eat.  The foot path seems to cut
diagonally across this area leading to a large vegetable garden growing
along the southern wall.  A few animals nip and bite at the grass keeping it
short, even someone's horse has been left to wander freely.  A small pond,
likely formed by collected rainwater, serves to provide the animals with a
drink.  A little closer to the wall stands a well for the monks to get
water.  A small crude roof has been constructed over the well to prevent
rainwater from filling it.  A bucket connected to a long rope sits on the
rim of the well waiting to be used.

A Guest Room~
A well furnished room is behind the oaken doors.  A large bed with a
matress filled with soft down feathers and an elegantly carved head board
rests between two tall windows.  A thick woolen, dark-red blanket lays
neatly over the mattress, a white rose laying on both of the fluffy pillows.
Each window is covered by thick maroon cloth, and a silken rope holding each
side open, to allow light to cascade into the room.  A fireplace with a
black metal screen is very clean, not being used in a very long time.  Two
chair upholstered in soft leather sit toward the fire, a small table between
the two with a lace doily upon it.  There is a few pieces of furniture
aesthetically placed about the room.  A western door leads out to the
hallway, while to the north is a door that is usually locked, leading to the
washroom.

Main Chamber of "De bibliotheca magnificus"~
This large chamber is at least 30 feet in length and 10 feet in width,
with monastic windows giving the room a view to the tree's outside, the
walls occasionally spaced out with torches to give a sense of lighting to
the room, most of the walls are covered in bookshelves with texts ranging
from the Quadrivium and Trivium of Academic studies, Hearth Lore's of
Iberia, the Holy Roman Empire, and The Venetian City States, Biblical Texts
and anything else imaginable.  The rest of the room is scattered with
tables, desks and accompanying chairs with appropriate candelabra, some
tables carrying inkwells and quills, as well as small compartments
containing parchment paper and in some cases papyrus, others much larger and
spaced out to allow study from multiple books.  A door all the way across
the room to the north is locked and marked with the words "Conclave
Occultus" in Latin on the door itself, to the east is a door marked with the
words "Vestibulum" in Latin, to the west is a door marked "Conclave
Pergulas" in Latin and to the south is the door marked "De bibliotheca
magnificus" leading back out to the archway.

#pInside the Monastery#n~
Two tall wooden doors open into the large worship area.  While not as
high as many of the larger churches, the ceilings in this Monastery are yet
vaulted rising maybe twenty feet from the floor.  The workmanship is
beautiful and a dozen arches, like huge ribs hold the roof high above.  A
spectacular round stained glass window sits just above the doors.  Its image
is of two hands folded together in prayer and surrounded by a bright light. 
Further west inside the Monastery row upon row of pews stands waiting for
visitors.

A Washroom~
This fairly large room is lit by hundreds of dancing flames from a myriad
of candles.  The floor is of a polished white marble, with a large oval
shaped bathtub, full of clean steaming water in its center.  There are three
stairs circleing the round tub.  Candles lit sporatically around the water
filled depression at the top of the steps.  Fresh white towels sit on wooden
shelves in a small inlet.  A rolled up white towel lays at what would be the
head of the tub and one is folded to the side.  A wooden table holds baskets
filled with exotic oils, salts and soaps, most untouched.  There is a larger
bottle three fourths of the way full with an oil.  On the top of the cork is
a small inked vanilla flower.  Mirrors of different sizes and shapes are
placed around the room so the lady of the house can look at herself at all
angles.  A door is to the south, usually locked, and a door to the east
leading back to the lady of the house's bedroom.

A hallway~
This corridor runs adjacent with the windows along the front of the
building, giving a good view of the trees outside the opposite wall clad
with torches and candles to light the place at night.  The hallway is
reminiscent of an eastern European monastery with Moorish architecture.  To
the west is a door with the words "Pergulas Quadrivium" in Latin, to the
north a door labeled "Pergulas Trivium" in Latin, to the east is the main
chamber, a small staircase leading up leads to a door way marked with
"Pergulas Academia" in Latin and a stairway leading down with a door reading
"Pergulas Musicus" and a doorway to the east leading back into the main
hall.

#pRows and rows of pews#n~
At least a dozen pews stand on either side of a central aisle which leads
to the Altar at the front of the church.  All of them are made of dark
mahogany and are beautifully constructed as if whoever commissioned the
building of this church certainly could afford to spare no expense.  On
either wall at a uniform height of aproximately eight feet above the floor
are six stained glass windows.  Each depicts a different scene.  One in
particular screams for attention.  It seems to be the scene in the bible
where Caine slays his brother Able.  A small #Cplaque#n is positioned beneath
it.

The Kitchen~
While the kitchen is rather large, it is hardly in use and is kept very
clean.  The floor is made of stone, except a wooden door in the floor out of
the way and the woodstove always has a pot of water warming or boiling over
it.  Pots and pans dangle from hooks around the room.  Bowls of fresh fruit
sit on polished marble countertops.  A few barrels of cool, clean water
lines the wall somewhat close to the woodstove, to make it easier to dip the
water for cooking.  Dried herbs and salted meats hang from beams by heavey
twine to keep any critter from easily accessing it.  A swinging door is to
the east, going to the dining area, while a door is to the north.

This classroom is where students learn about the Academic Quadrivium:
Arithmetic, Geometry, Astronomy and Musical Composition.  The room has a
small shelf full of different tools ranging from Abacuses, Map-making
instruments, and algebraic instruments.  Beside the tools are a stack of
wooden boards covered with wax and a few sets of ivory styluses to write on,
the main desk with books and parchments is in front of a large waxen board
and a larger ivory stylus beside it, most of the room has enough space for
every student to sit down at a chair or the floor if need be.  The room is
well lit with torches along the walls.  The door to the east leads into the
hallway.

The Altar stands here.  In the center of the large altar is a statue of
the Virgin Mary holding an infant Christ.  Starting on the left and moving
to the right in sequence are several scenes behind this.  The first one
depicts His birth and events as such.  While the Virgin and Child might
occupy a central position, the surrounding panels develope a central theme
focused on Christ as Savior, depicting His Incarnation, Passion, Death and
Resurrection, and especially the Eucharist, or Last Supper.  A door stands
off to the left of the Altar and kind of hidden in shadows of the west wall.

Servant's Quarters~
This small drab room, holds no elements to spruce it up or make it
anymore than what it is- where the help sleeps.  There are three beds in the
room, each covered with an average quality, grey woolen blanket.  Plain
wooden trunks are at the foot of each bed, for the belongings of the
servitor.  Two drafty windows are in the space between the three beds while
a small fire place absent of fire is against the southern wall.  The floors
are made of stone, some rocks shaking loosly when tread upon.  There is a
small table in the corner where the retainer can take their meals.  An unlit
candle resides in its center, wax having been dripped down to seal it to the
table during its previous use.  There is a door to the south leading back to
the kitchen.

with various scrolls and books, and the board is much larger and smoother
than the one in the other classrooms.  The desk for this room seems to be
built on a small podium of sorts, and most of the students sit on a
amphitheater shaped floor.  Most of the room looks to be designed to project
your voice across its entirety for speaking practice.  The room is well lit
with torches along the walls.  The door south leads to the hallway.

The loose stone stairs lead below the kitchen to the cold, dark wine
cellar.  The smell of wet dirt assalts the senses as one enters.  This room
is fairly compact, with three of the walls lined with wine racks,
sporatically holding a bottle of fine wine in its diamond shaped cubby
holes.  Three few kegs of wine sit toward the center, aging to perfection. 
Since not many come to the area, it isnt as well kept as the rest of the
house, cobwebs hanging from the rafters and between unused parts of the wine
rack.

#pThe top of the bell tower#n~
A narrow platform runs around the inside of the bell tower.  Open portals
in all four walls offer a somewhat restricted three hundred and sixty degree
view of the surrounding area.  A road can be seen off to the northeast. 
Cordoba can be made out in the distance to the north.  A small cemetary lies
near the church to the west.  The forests masks any real view of the south. 
The windows in the tower are constructed in such a way so as to keep rain
out and consequently also allow someone to look out at the yard around the
church without they themselves being observed easily.  The enormous church
bell hangs here as well, one would certainly not want to be here in the
event that it was rung, the resulting sound could potentially be deafening.

full of scrolls and parchment which look to have been used a bit.  The whole

rolls of parchment and leather-bound books that are either half-written in
or blank, a luxurious chair is placed with the desk to give the dimly
candelabra lit room a sense of value.  A statue lies behind the chair that
depicts an angel holding two weighted balance plates in its hands.  A door
to the south leads into the main chamber.

and completely without decoration of any kind.  All of them likely lead to
the monks' quarters.  All along the north wall is a beautiful fresco
depicting the the story of Christ in sort of a timeline from His birth to
His death and finally His ressurection.

A Private Library~
Entering from the north, the first thing noticed are rows of bookshelves
lining almost every inch of all four walls.  Three tables form small island
in the middle of the room, each with extravagant chairs tucked against them.
Upon the tables, inkwells and feathered quills idly await to be used.  A
candelabra lights the area from the center of the room.  On the western
wall, compositions of poetry in varying languages stand out from the few
local history and mathematics books

#pA simple monk's room#n~
This room is not made for comfort, it is made with nessecity in mind.  A
simple wooden bed with a small pad as a matress rests against one wall.  A
trunk sits at the foot of the bed for clothes and maybe one or two personal
items.  Above the head of the bed hangs simple wooden crucifix.  On the
other side of the room is a simple table, there is nothing laying on the
table however on the bed is an unopened bible.

Catacombs beneath the Library~
These catacombs are built under the library above and as you look around
them you see a style of construction very reminiscent of eastern European
catacombs and even slightly reminiscent of ancient Greek or Carthaginian
structures.  A few torches light this room barely at best.  To the west is a
horridly crumbled down pathway and to the east is a dimly lit hall.

The Dining Hall~
A luxurious dining hall stretches out within the heart of the estate. 
The same red oak has been used to create a finely polished dining table that
extends from one end of the room to the other offering ample places for many
guests to gather about.  The only light of the room comes from a line of
candles running the length of the table.  A large stone fireplace provides
heat for the room and most of the house due to the parallel design.  This
style also offers for a summer breeze to easily blow throughout the estate. 
Flavor rich foods drift into the dining hall from the kitchens to the south.

This section of the hall is pitch black and if you feel around you can
sense a lot of rubble around you; apparently this area has collapsed or has
been purposely knocked down, whatever the case may be.  Who knows what is to
the west, and the hallway in the catacombs leads east.

Three massive wood burning stoves line far wall.  Hanging just above the
stoves are various spices in small containers.  Fastened to the ceiling are
dried meats that permeate the air with their scent intermingled with the
pungent smell of garlic and salts.  In the center of the room is a bakers
table, set with knives and other cooking needs.  On the ground, there is an
wooden trap door with a small cast iron ring, leading to a storage cellar.

A dead end in the Catacombs~
This area is brightly lit compared to the others, and the walls are
covered in random symbols (written in Babel) meaning "Heed these words young
madman, lest ye mind be invaded by powerful forces" If you look towards the
dead end you see a door leading down and against the wall there is a
sculpture built into the wall that resembles a man trying to push his way
out of the wall.  The hallway leads back west.

This room is almost a large void of darkness except for a lantern left on
a desk, the lantern shining over various writings and a inkwell with a quill
stylus, a simple chair accompanies the simple desk and if the lantern is
shown around the walls bookshelf upon bookshelf can be seen with various
scriptures and some empty bookshelves can bee seen which seem to be left
over in case more books come in.  To the farther side away from all of the
bookshelves is a coffin built into the floor, the symbols on the coffin read
(in Babel) "Here lays Inuistatio del Cruz, the Befuddled of Salzburg,
Harbinger of Venice."  The doorway upwards leads back into the catacombs.

Simplicity is the key element to this room, its stark white walls
disrupted only by a dark cherry wood wardrobe and the simple single-person
bed lining the opposite wall.  The bedspread is a deep burgundy color and is
void of any embroidery or decorative pillows.  Light is fed through the room
by a small window.  The curtains have been precisely pinned back to reveal
the decorative landscaping of the house's southern grounds.  Two doors lead
in and out of the room, one leading to the hallway, while the second smaller
door leads to the kitchens.

area for anyone that is a guest of the estate.  A small wooden table with a
white lace cloth displays various personal items, among them are a vial of
perfume and a small silver brush.  Across the room is a four-post bed with a
white sheer canopy draping about the sides.  Upon the bed is a white spread,
and several oversized goose feather pillows.  On the eastern wall is a
bookshelf filled with books on topics of local interest.  Pushed against the
far wall, a personal sized desk and chair are illuminated by a tiny oil
lamp.  When lit it gives the subtly warm radiance that seems to never reach
the corners of the room.

This large and expansive room is truly easily noticed to be the master
bedroom of the estate.  Two twin oil lamps cast a soft glow about the room
allowing the corners to remain deep within the shadows.  A massive four post
bed rests in the center of the room.  Deep amethyst drapes and bed linens
seem to be the only color of the room besides that of the red oak from which
the bed and private desk are made.  The heavy drapes upon the windows in the
room and hanging from the canopy of the bed, block out all the light from
the outside world.  The fragrance of fresh flowers gently drifts through the
air

#pPath behind the Monastery#n~
Tall weeds stand to either side of the path leading to the cemetary. 
Most are only waist high but, as thick as they are, anything could be hiding
amongst them.  To the west are the small cemetery gates and back to the east
stands the Monastery.  The wind picks up for just a moment and the rustle of
the weeds suddenly masks every other sound except for the dry stalks rubbing
together.  A sound, almost like an eerie scream can barely be heard on the
wind, as if it may or may not have been there.

of the #Cheadstone#ns are pretty much the same with a few exceptions.  A

A large oak door lies to the south closed tight until another patient
enters the hospital's walls.  The ceiling is high, the walls mostly bare and
the floor lined with plain white tiles easy to clean.  A few nursemaids walk
back and forth patrolling the hospital willing to answer questions and
direct the injured to the rooms in the back to wait for their treatment. 
North lies the waiting area and south leads back outside into the usually
peaceful courtyard.

A few chairs have been pushed against the western wall as well as an old
plush couch that was donated to this establishment here for those who wish
to wait on the health of a comrade or family member.  To the east lies a
small chapel for any who would wish to pray, south lies the way out and
north are the rooms in which the patients are brought to.  Also to the west
lies the private office of the resident doctor of this hospice.  A small
cross lies on the wall above a simple desk hung above the makeshift nurses
station as a sign of hope for all who enter this place.  The rest of the
walls have a few bits of donated #bartwork#n but nothing extravagant, just
something to keep the mind busy as the time passes.

artwork~
The western wall sports two paintings hung next to one another.  The
pieces seem to give those within this room hope or simply something to pass
the time around as they focus on the minute details or the colors of the
swirling paint.
 
Painting One: A gorgeous blue sea stretches out to the
horizon.  The painting seems to be of a boat sailing at night.  The stars
overhead are so numerous it is a wonder the artist was able to paint so
many.  The ship appears to be a large shipping vessel with tiny figures
srambling all over it in the dark.  A small lamp has been painted on near
the rudder showing a man studying a map.
 
Painting Two: An island stands
alone in a vast sea in this painting.  A large mountain looms in the center
of the island, covered with trees.  A reef clearly surrounds the island as
waves with white tops seem to break upon it.  The surf looks so real and
it's almost like the ocean itself can be heard.  Light colored sandy beaches
surround the island and it appears uninhabited.

Within a cave~
A tunnel leads into a cave of moderate size.  The cave reeks of mustiness
and the damp cold of the underground.  No light enters reaches the depths,
nor do candles or a fireplace shed light on the dark reaches.  If one were
to illumninate this place they would see strange marks and dark green moss
covering the rock walls.  Some tree roots and stalactites jut out from the
ceiling and walls.

far enough away from Cordoba proper for a cemetary placement.  Rows upon
rows of crosses can be seen protruding from the ground, marking the
placements of graves.  Those of noble blood are easily spotted by their
large inscribed gravestones or, for those of exceeding wealth, entire crypts
and masoleums dedicated to their families.

#eAmongst the headstones in the Graveyard#n~
The gravestones here are certainly very well tended.  Not a single weed
grows within the small stone wall which surrounds the small graveyard.  Most
of the #Cheadstone#ns are pretty much the same with a few exceptions.  A chill
wind seems to blow through the small cemetary all year round as if an odd
reminder that this is truly a place of the dead.  More headstones can be
seen in every direction.

#wA Patient's Room#n~
This room is simple, clean and lightly furnished as a patients room
should be.  A small cot is tucked in the corner of the room but allows
passage on all four sides of the cot so that a nurse could manuver around it
with ease.  A simple desk lies next to the cot and holds a water pitcher and
basin for the washing of hands.  Within that top drawer of the desk is held
a few simple bandages and other common tools of the hospital.  The cot also
has a small pillow atop it along with an itchy wool blanket.  A new
#bpainting#n has been added to the wall to give the patient something to
calm themselves as they are waiting for help or something to pass the time.

The sky seems to be the most prominent feature of this painting.  Filled
with many clouds, which cross over a huge blazing sun, it covers more than
three-fourths of the canvas.  A flock of geese cross the sky in a V
formation.  A large field stretches out in all directions dotted here and
there with various trees and plant life.

This area south of the Guadalquivir river was for the most part unused
until the Reconquista reached the city.  Still within the city walls it is
far enough away from Cordoba proper for a cemetary placement.  Rows upon
rows of crosses can be seen protruding from the ground, marking the
placements of graves.  Those of noble blood are easily spotted by their
large inscribed gravestones or, for those of exceeding wealth, entire crypts
and masoleums dedicated to their families.

Snow covers the top of the mountain in this painting.  Stretching from
one end of the horizon to the other it stands like a sentinel guarding the
plains below.  A river seems to descend from the mountain flowing into a
large still lake.  Toward one end of the lake a flock of ducks float. 
Amazingly enough even their reflections upon the water have been captured.

Before a steel door~
This small room is almost completely dark, save for a bit of ambiant
light filtering down from the stair case.  The walls here are formed of
large squared stones fitted tightly together and mortared in place.  The
floor appears to be a single slab of hard stone, perhaps granite, and it
seems to run far beneath the walls.  Drops of water can be heard as water
condenses on the cool stone walls and falls to the hard floor.  Set into the
stone of the southern wall is a massive steel door.

beam in the middle to support the roof.

This room is cool and the air is dry, making it quite comfortable.  The
stone floor is covered almost entirely by a large drab coloured rug, and the
walls are decorated with paintings of forests.  Several shelves are pushed
against the walls, and each is filled with books.  A large couch and four
chairs are placed around a rectangular table of stained hardwood.  Set atop
several of the bookcases and in the center of the table are softly glowing
orbs that illuminate the room.  Wide, open doorways lead to the south and
east.

wide wooden surface serves as the counter for the shop, with the space above
forming an open-air arch.  Beyond stand a pair of floor-to-ceiling wooden
cabinets, padlocked against intrusion.  Along the walls in the back stand
two desks, with blocks of paper, inkwells, quills, and other assorted scribe
supplies.  There is no sign of anything of value, for business here is by
appointment only.  To that end, a book lies open upon the counter, with
quill, ink, and sandbag beside it, for an appointment request to be left if
no one is present.

A massive warehouse, built on two levels - one above ground, one below -
stretches out into the distance.  For myriad reasons, no windows look onto
this space - it is lit periodically by hanging lanterns, only at the
crossroads of the aisles.  At any given moment, perhaps half of this storage
area is full, with half being left empty either to accommodate shipments not
yet arrived, or simply to allow space between rows.  Rows, that is, of casks
upon casks of wine.  Three tiers deep along the distant wall stand
wood-and-metal racks dedicated to green-glass bottles of wine, stored tipped
downward to keep the corks wet, each bearing the Lucianos Vineyards tag,
detailing which specific location it came from, what year, and what sort of
quality one can expect from each individual bottle.  Two burly guards armed
with ranseurs and clad in scale-mail composite armor stand just inside the
door, making absolutely certain anyone coming in actually has business being
here.  Beyond the guards, in the two corners nearest the door, spiral
staircases wind upwards.

This space is filled with heavy wooden racks containing armor of varying

displaying the Lucianos coat of arms beside the individual crests of their
owners.  At any moment at least two-thirds of the beds in this room are
occupied by hulking guards, in differing states of alertness - some fully
asleep and snoring loudly, to some fully alert, either just coming on or
just coming off their shifts and about half still armored.  Beyond them to
the west is a massive door made of hammer-aged yew, reinforced with many
belts of steel and sporting a very solid metal handle and lock.

that is more of a bed than a real table.  On each side of the table,
restraints have been placed made of a thick metal for those unruly patients
or those who have lost their minds.  A small desk with two drawers lies near
the table and its drawers are full of various surgical utensils that can
very well be described as unusual and possibly torture-like types.  There is
no window of course in this room for it lies below ground and beyond that
the room is relativly clean and simple.

#yThe Yard#n~
Outside, behind the warehouse, stands a wide open courtyard, shielded
from the street by a ten-foot wall of stone, grown over on either side with
ivy.  A wooden gate wide enough for two wagons to pass through abreast leads
out onto the street, and is usually kept open.  The courtyard itself is
paved, after a fashion, with many wide, flat slabs of nondescript
blueish-grey stone - slate, perhaps, or a similarly sturdy but unobtrusive
rock.  Several noteworthy features come immediately to attention, though. 
One is the row of simple wooden stables along the eastern wall, built to
accommodate the horses of those who might have business within, as anyone
who has the privilege of entering through the Yard certainly owns a horse. 
Along the southern wall stands another enclosed building, though perhaps
less enclosed than that stables: a small but functional smithy, sporting
barrels of plain and salted water and thin tempering oil, arranged to be
mutually convenient for any of the three anvils and their respective
furnaces.  A door in the Western wall leads into the warehouse proper, and
as might be expected, a pair of spear-wielding armor-clad guards keeps watch
over that entrance.

This room is practically just a hole in the ground but it is plenty
enough for the doctor of the hospital.  A small oak desk is pushed in the
corner of the room and parchment, quill and ink lie atop it.  But a few
steps past the desk is a small bed holding few luxeries save for a straw
matress, pillow and blanket.  A small bookshelf lies next to the desk and
holds more hand written notes than real books and has plenty of room to
place more items.  The only light in the room is from a small lantern on the
desk and from a few randomly placed candles.  A simple trunk lies at the
foot of the bed to store personal goods and clothing and is the last piece
of furniture in the room.

#gCourtyard of the fortress#n~
Behind large wooden gates and a heavy iron porcullis lies the courtyard
of this fortress.  Once used as a fortification for the Moorish leaders of
the Cordoba Caliphate this fortress fell to Christian armies and is now
occupied by the Castillian lord of Cordoba.  On either sides of the gate are
turrets occupied by guards at all times.  This courtyard area is huge, with
orange trees lining the walkway up to the entrance of the fortress and to
the guard barracks on the far eastern side of the courtyard.  A large
fountain stands in the middle of this green area, providing water for the
fortresses inhabitants and animals, most of whom are housed in the stables
near the barracks.

Work Area of the Smithy~
Entering the large lean-to that spans the entire side of the Smith's
shop, your nose is assaulted by the powerful smell of burning wood that
seems to permeate the area.  Three large tables are spread around the area,
various tools used in the trade rest upon them.  A massive furnace burns
bright and hot, spanning nearly half the building in length with the
blacksmith's anvil just visible beyond one of the tables.  A neatly kept
work area stands not far from it, well used tools are hung in a tidy order,
kept in easy reach.  Several brimming barrels of water are kept close by for
easy access.  Just off the lean-to, a small, well kept stable, large enough
for two horses, can be seen.

#wA Modest Courtyard#n~
A pebbled path not yet worn from use leads to the west to what can only
be described as a small shack.  Directly north is the charity hospital of
cordoba and to the east heads back to the streets of the city.  Around the
area are a few benches set up for any who wish to wait outside and enjoy the
gifts of nature and the peace and quiet that usually resides here.  A few
small trees have been freshly planted here and have not yet taken root, but
other than that the courtyard is empty.

A Blacksmith's Shoppe~
The stone floor of this shop seems to have been laid in place in an
effort to give the room a little extra flair.  Upon the walls many
handcrafted tools, weapons and pieces of armor are hung up for display.  The
tools include pickaxes, scythes with several different blades, sickles,
hammers, pitch forks and random types of sharpened blades are all towards
the back.  Weapons and armor being the prized selection are all on exhibit
just as you come in.  Each piece seeming to be a precisely detailed work of
craftsmanship.  Big bins of nails and brackets sit off to the side, while
screens and other metal goods are stratigically placed about the shop.  The
smell of wood burning makes it way from the door to the west.  A wooden
counter cuts the room in two unequal halves, with stairs leading up into the
closed living area.  The door at the top of stairs is marked "Private" in
neat handwriting.  Behind the counter, off to the east there is a door
simply labeled "Storage".  On the inside of the door is a bell, giving some
notice that someone is present in the shop.

This is Cordoba's marketplace.  The street widens here so that many
merchants can have the room to set up stalls.  Used by day to hold Cordoba's
large markets, merchants come from far and wide to have a chance to hawk
their wares in this large city.  Many of the buildings around here are used
by the city's craftsmen and guilds.

#wA Small Shack#n~
This shack is a sort of place to store carriages or horses for those
wealthy enough to have such a luxery.  A few servants are here to give the
basic necessities to the horses, watering them and offering a bit of hay or
oats depending on the season.  Anything else wanted by the owners of the
animals must be paid for in advance, after all there is so much charity a
hospital can be ran off of.

#cBefore the guard barracks#n~
The guard barracks loom before you.  Although used for military purposes,
the unique architecture style of the barracks makes it seem more like a
mini-palace and an offshoot of the fortress than a utilitarian structure
built for housing troops.  Against the south wall of the sprawling fortress
complex is the low-lying thathed building that comprises the stables. 
Although the bulk of the animals housed there are horses, both fine arabians
and the massive warhorses so popular elsewhere in Europe, there are also
dozens of cows, chickens and pigs.  Most of these domestic animals are kept
in the stables until they are slaughtered for food, so that they do not
become a meal for the dogs that roam about the fortress.

Common Room~
Upon opening the door to the living area of the shop, the floor creaks
beneath any weight put upon it.  A bed made of a warm hued wood, almost
honey in color rests against the wall with a down filled matress.  Draped
over the matress is a hunter-green blanket, which lightly brushes the wooden
floor planks.  A trunk is at the foot of the bed, aesthetic in design, but
practical in use.  A well used, screened in, brick fireplace always has a
low flame radiating a little light and heat.  A glassless window is near the
bed, shutters pulled closed when the weather is inclimate.  A small kitchen
type area is near the fireplace, including a small round table with a few
chairs.  A few pieces of salted meat hangs from the rafter from twine to
keep the mice from getting to it, while other food items are stored on
cabinet shelves, built into the corner.  A well worn, yet comfortable
looking, midnight blue sofa offers seating to any guest that should need it.

#pVargas Stable Entrance#n~
The entrance to the stables is a large room that opens into a larger area
further back.  The sounds and smells of the horses stabled here are
noticable even before entering the actual stable area.  Fresh straw covers
the wooden floor, usually just thrown over the dirty floor covering
underneath it.  The lighting within is dim, open flame being dangerous in a
place filled with so much dry tinder.  Wooden beams are visible overhead and
off to the west is a door leading to the offices.  Just ahead is a large
open archway, marked with the same rough-hewn wooden beams that support the
ceiling above, that leads to where the horses are kept.  To the east lies La
Puerta del Sur, the south gate, where travellers can enter to bring their
horses for stabling, or hire carriages for travel.  The stables' office is
just through the door to the west.

floor.  A cross hangs above the doorway and three tapestries hang on the
walls, depicting various Catholic saints.  The heavy, reinforced wooden
doors that lead to and from the barracks can be locked by use of a large
crossbar that lies against the wall, ready to be swung into place should the
fortress ever come under attack.  A stone staircase leads up from here to
the towers and dormitories of the barracks.  Doors open to the north, south
and east.

copper, tin, iron and many other types of material.  On the right, pieces of
wood which have been sanded and ready for use, are separated by size on each
shelf.  A barrel of bolts and other small pieces sits alone in the corner. 
In the other corner, several full sized logs have been stacked on top of one
another.

This small room serves as the offices for the Livery and Stables.  Any
business to be conducted takes place here.  The floor is wooden planks,
though some straw from the entrance has strayed into the office, and even
with a closed door, the strong odor of horses and leather permeates.  A
large desk, well worn, dominates the room, with a large paned window serving
as a natural lighting for the small office.  An oil lamp sits upon the desk,
though seems rarely used, and various bits of tack and harness hang on the
office's walls.  A small door opens off to the west, leading into the living
quarters for those who run the stables.

of each bed a small chest for personal belongings.  Two fireplaces are also
installed in this hall to heat it during the winters.

The smell of horses is stronger here in the stables, with their stalls
lining the west wall.  The occasional stomp or snort of one of the stall's
inhabitants can be heard as the equine tenants of the stable move about in
their stalls, or peer out at passersby.  A wide central aisle, supported by
wooden beams, is covered by a layer of straw, though one would still be wise
to watch one's footing walking through here.  Along the eastern wall are
where some of the equipment to care for the horses is kept, on hand for easy
accessibility.  Farther ahead, on the east side of the stables, is a set of
double doors leading to the corral where the horses are taken for exercise.

weapons and knight's armor.  The doors are always kept tightly locked, for
fear of theft.  The weapons and armor here is all quite large, those piece
of equipment that are too big to go anywhere else.  Suits of metal armor,
spears, javelins, heavy crossbows and large swords all lean against the wall
or are set up on wooden shelves or, in the case of the armor, hung upon
dummies.

wood with a little straw thrown here and there, and several, open, glassless
windows allow for light and fresh air for the stable-hands and the horses,
though the smell of horse, leather, and hay still abounds, despite the
breeze the windows allow.  Wide doors to the west and north allow for horses
to be brought in and out of both the stables and the corral before being
hitched to a carriage or wagon.

easily climbable.

room at the end of the stalls, for the equpment needed to care for the
animals.  To the east lies a set of double doors, allowing access to the
corral.  A small ladder is propped up over to the side, leading up into the

of criminals stay when the Calahorra Fort's prisons are full, or simply
where those especially important or dangerous political or religious
criminals stay to await trial or, more likely, execution.

trained or broke here as well, as it easily has the most room in the Stable.
The ground is hard packed dirt, though clouds of dust are stirred up by the
passing of horses as they run about the exercise yard.  A sturdy wooden-beam
fence surrounds the corral, high enough to foil all but the most determined
of jumpers.  Large double doors provide a means to move horses in and out of
the corral into the carriage house

walls in the hallway on the other side of the large barred and locked steel
door.  A smell metal bowl rests in one corner of the cell, and a soiled
straw pallet against one wall is used for sleeping.

A Forest Clearing~
Very little resides in this place in the way of large thick trees.  It
looks more or less like a few trees have been cut down to make way for
something else, farmland or perhaps a home years ago.  It is slowly being
overgrown over time and to the north and south the forest continues on along
the river.  Few persons travel this road during anytime of the day or night.

Qibla~
A small roofed area lies before a wall facing the direction of Mecca,
called the Quibla.  There are no doors in this wall and a small notch is in
that wall, called the Mihrab facing the direction of the Quibla.  A small
pulpit stands off to the side of the Mihrab placed there for the more
relaxed prayers during the weekends.  A small shelf lies above the Mihrab
and holds a few containers of burning incense and on the floor lies a few
offerings placed by those who congregate here.

rough and jagged, and the floor is little more than smooth rock.  Against

This room is quite large by inn lodgings standards.  The reputation for
extravagance is well earned, as these rooms are decorated with the finest
carpets, curtained windows, and furniture.  A large four-poster bed stands
against the far wall, near the window, and has a feather matress and a
pillow, as well as a thick blanket.  There is also a small table and three
chairs in the center of the room, and small fireplace to one side, an
armoire and a writing desk not far from that.  All rooms in this place are
also quite clean, being attended by servants nearly every day.

A cozy home~
The first thing easily noticed about this extremely small room is that it
is very clean and many candles decorate the whole room.  Placed at random
intervals upon the walls, hanging from the ceiling from lengthy chains and
sitting upon pedestals lining the edge of the room.  There is very little
furniture about, a few chairs and a rug that covers the middle of the floor,
is about it.  Overall for being in the slums, this home looks rather cozy.

a window that looks down upon the courtyard below.  Swords, arrows, daggers,
bows, crossbows and spears are contained in this room in large amounts,
stacked on top of each other and anywhere they can be fit.  These weapons
are constantly being sharpened and taken care of by the soldiers and squires
so that are are ready for use should the need ever arise.

Down a staircase~
After pulling up the rug, a small locked trap door leads to a dark
stairwell.  The walls and steps are all cut of stone and small coves are set
within the wall for candles to cast light upon any that might venture down. 
Often the candles are not burning, causing nothing but the cold darkness to
come up from the depth of the stairs.  After reaching the bottom there is a
heavy set iron door with a huge lock upon keeping outsiders away.

Wood stoves and thick chopping tables stand all about this large cooking
area.  Pots, pans and knives all hang from hooks over stoves and sinks. 
This is where the meals are cooked for the knights staying at the barracks. 
With so many mouths to feed these kitchens are staffed just about around the
clock, constantly preparing food for someone.  Some of the lower servants
not lucky enough to sleep in dormitories also make their beds here near the
warm stoves at night.

Within a Basement~
As soon as the iron door opens from the stairwell, the smell of stagnant
water and mold floods the air.  The room, like the first floor, has candles
situated about it casting light throughout the room.  Direct center of the
room sits a round stone well, with a standard water bucket and wench.  A
large curtain has been placed over the eastern wall.  The curtain ripples
every now and then as the cold air circulates about the room.

Passage to the sewers~
Behind the banner there is yet another secret
passageway, though unlike the stairs, it does not have
a single space for candles upon the wall. The passage
is fairly cramped, only about two feet across and any
man of average height would have to duck to walk
within it. At the end of the passage an iron barred
door leads out into what seems to be the sewers of
Cordoba.

food, a table is positioned in the middle of the room as of to the northeast
seems to be a door to another room.

of the floor.

It seems that this is the nerve center for all of this persons work, what
ever that might be.  The floor has drains at a few intervals for what
purpose is unknown until the room is really looked at, torches can be seen
at intervals to give enough light for whatever is done down here.  There are
three tables in the room, one can be identified as an examination type
table, with iron restraints.  The second smaller table next to it has many
implements on it and the third seems to be a stretching sort of machine. 
There are four sets of shackles about the room one in peticular is between
to pillar-like structures.  There is a room to the west that seems
unoccupied at the moment.

Looming up from the ground are the tall walls of the city of Cordoba. 
The city is so large that the walls wrap around so far they seem to
disappear into the horizon.  These are the large gates of the West Gate.  A
large metal portcullis spans the large gap in the walls and thick oak double
doors that stand over two stories high swing open into the city.  The gate
itself is wide enough for several carts to pass side by side.

Put south of 10097 The Guadalquivir river has now slowed down forming a
large mass of thick squishy semi-ground.  The ground has now turned to swamp
lands and now and then taking the wrong step can mean certain death to any
not able to swim if they are lucky to avoid the quick sands.  One certainly
has to learn their way about these lands to protect themselves.  The swamp
continues on into the deeper regions and shows no sign of inhabitance by
much of anything or anyone.

out of Cordoba.  There are a few small deer paths through the grass leading
up to the woods, which at the tree line are dotted with young trees.  The

blackness looms as the woods grow more dense.

#PRuins of a Small Roman Villa#n~
At the end of a decrepit street sit the remnants of an old, Roman villa. 
The building has fallen into disrepair, with most of the outer walls long
since gone and anything of value removed by looters years ago.  At the heart
of the ruined villa is an atrium, which for the most part seems to be mostly
intact.  Long years of neglect have marred what at what time must have been
a lovely place to escape the bustle of city life.  Some of the decorative
columns have fallen over where parts of the roof around the atrium collapsed
and much of the white marble flooring is chipped and covered with dirt and
debris.  In the center of the atrium is a deep pool of water that appears to
have been made into a fountain of sorts.  Rising from the middle of the pool
is a stone statue of a man with long, flowing hair and a gentle smile.  He
is wearing simple robes and is eternally posed with his arms held out in a
wide embrace.  Water flows out of holes cut into the palms of the statue's
hands and falls into the pool, apparently indicating the wounds Christ
suffered during the crucifixion.  The pool itself is ringed with a marble
lip upon which is carved an #Pinscription#n.  Three unadorned stone benches
flank the pool, providing a place to sit and reflect.

#PDark Tunnel and Antechamber#n~
In the dark, cool depths at the bottom of the pool, is an opening in the
natural rock wall.  Leading off into darkness is a tunnel, filled with cold
fresh water that would seem to indicate both the tunnel and pool above are
connected to an underground stream.  The tunnel itself twists and turns, all
the while in total darkness, making it almost impossible to determine which
way is forward and which way leads back to the garden.  Eventually the
tunnel opens up into a larger chamber with stairs carved into the rock
leading up, out of the water.  The chamber is dimly illuminated by two metal
braziers flanking a stone archway beyond which are stairs descending back
into darkness.  The archway itself is covered in hieroglyphs depicting
various scenes of men and women with the heads of animals.  Metal hooks in
the walls provide a place to hang wet clothes while a nearby stone bench has
clean towels to dry off with and delicate skirts of fine linen to change
into.

#gEdge of the woods#n~
Trees begin to crop up from the gently rolling hills of the countryside
out of Cordoba.  There are a few small deer paths through the grass leading
up to the woods, which at the tree line are dotted with young trees.  The
sounds of birds and crickets are a constant here, and up ahead to the east
blackness looms as the woods grow more dense.

#PUnderground Temple#n~
The stone stairs from above descend into a long and dark chamber. 
Several inches of sand cover the floor and the #Pwalls#n are barely visible
in the dim light provided by strategically placed braziers.  The entire
chamber is shrouded in darkness in such a way that the true dimensions of
this room can only be guessed at.  At the far end of the chamber is a large
stone alter.  Looming behind the alter is a large #Pstatue#n.  A plain
wooden bowl rests before the statue on the alter, traces of a dark sticky
residue line the inside of the bowl.  The scent of perfume and blood linger
in the air.

walls~
The walls of the dark chamber are covered with old Egyptian artwork
depicting scenes from ancient Egypt interlaced with hundreds of archaic
hieroglyphs telling the story of the pharoah Amenhotep IV and his queens. 
The flickering shadows dance across the painted surface of the walls almost
returning to life the images of people long dead.  
~
E
statue~
The tall, dark statue behind the altar stands about 8 feet tall and is
carved from onyx.  The statue itself is of a strange being with a stiff
forked tail, a long gaunt body, a tapering snout, huge erect ears and
protruding eyes.  Staring at the statue too long creates a sense of unease
as if you are being watched or in the presence of something you can't see.

#PBedroom#n~
Hidden behind the onyx statue is a doorway covered with a black curtain. 
Pushing past the curtain reveals another chamber.  This room is dominated by
a large, comfortable bed with a linen canopy that is nearly transparent. 
Plush red cushions cover most of the floor.  A large wooden dresser flanks
the bed on one side with a framed, standing mirror beside it.  On the other
side of the bed is a writing desk complete with pen, ink and parchment. 
Resting upright in the far corner of the room is a wooden #Psarcophagus#n. 
A large bronze brazier hangs from the ceiling by three linked chains,
providing ample light and heat for this chamber.  Incese burns in a delicate
bronze holder shaped like an Egyptian river boat.  The incense mingles with
the scent of carnal lust fulfilled that permeates this chamber.

A Small Shack~
This is a often used shack sporting almost no furniture save for a small
and very aged cot in the corner.  There are piles of refuse about the floor
and the nearly constant chatter of rats and insects can be heard.  The door
is almost always open, if you can call it a door that is for it creeks
loudly as if the hinges are ready to fall off though the wood of the door
seems to be way ahead in detiriation.

anchored firmly into the wall.  There is a small, grey wool blanketed bed
set against the eastern wall.  A thick, locked door leads west to the

Wooden docks, ranging from small rafts tied to shore to large docks made
from many untimbered trees jut into the Guadalquivir river here, causing
small eddys and currents to rock the boats moored there.  Countless men
labor along the shores at all hours, unloading and loading boats, helping
passengers, performing repairs and moving cargo.  About fifty meters from
the banks of the river, rows of taverns, pubs, inns, brothels and small
tinker and tailor shops, creating a plaza of sorts between the river and
buildings.  This plaza is crowded with people and cargo.  Whores, laborers
and mercenaries wander through the crowd, looking for work, and not a single

crimson and white linen bed coverings suggest this is yet another bedroom. 
While a hint of white walls can be seen, each wall is covered with wide
panels of cherry colored linen, masking almost ever aspect of the walls
underneath, also making the room seem much more intimate.  A large, free
standing chest is set against the western wall, set out a bit from the wall.
An ovular white rug covers the dark wood floor underneath the bed.  Bouquets
of flowers decorate nearly all flat surfaces, save the floor and the bed.  A
door to the south leads on to a long balcony.

This large room is dark and smokey, the air heavy with the scents of
hashish, opium, and other exotic herbs.  Dim light is cast by lanterns
shaded with thin blue cloth, causing an odd illuminating effect in the
constantly swirling smoke.  In the middle of the room there are several
tables set up with chairs surrounding them.  On each table is a ceramic
hookah with four mouth pieces.  Against the walls there are couches, and
curtained bunk beds, each large enough for two people to fit comfortably. 
Women dressed in dark blue robes and veils are ever ready to attend to a
needy customer.  Most of the beds, and several of the tables are occupied by
a wide array of customers.  A large door in the north wall leads into
another room, from which the women come and go.

by the city's craftsmen and guilds.

The inside of this tavern is dimly lit, and a fire burns low in a hearth
in the western wall.  A long bar splits the room, two thirds furnished with
heavy tables and chairs, one third taken up by a kitchen, and barrels of
ale, mead and wine.  A huge, flat plate, nearly a meter in diameter, cut
from a massive tree is mounted on the southern wall, its surface pocked and
scarred by darts and knives.  The tavern, except for the four guards, is
completely staffed by moorish women dressed in dark blue robes and veils. 
It caters primarily to dockworkers, fishermen, and poor travelers, who make
up the mixed population of patrons.  A door leads east from the kitchen
area, and another leads back to the docks to the south.  A stairway leads up
to the common room.

A loom dominates this small shop, perpetually in use.  In one corner

the room, warring with the acrid scent of a partially covered dyer's vat.

are easily displayed.  A variety of sewing, small cloth squares, ribbon,
lace, cord, feathers, beads and other accessories appear on one side, while
bolts of cloth, some finished pieces and ladies soaps and scented items are
placed along the other.  A long counter, stretching from one wall almost to
the other is across the back of the room and beautiful embroidery work is
displayed on the back wall as well as a variety of dried herbs tied in
bundles, causing pleasant smells to waft on the air.  A small doorway leads

each corner of the room.  Although the walls are not thick or soundproof,
the noise generated by the tavern, whorehouse and hashish den are normally
more than enough to keep any conversations private.  To help in this goal
large, persian rugs are hung on the walls, adding a splash of color, and
helping to dampen sounds.

of the same ilk.  Large couches and chairs are aranged around tables with
hookahs, and several areas are portioned off with curtains.  A dozen
bunkbeds line the walls, each with its own curtain to give some measure of
privacy to the occupants.  The smell of opium and hashish is thick in the

hangs above a large comfy looking double size bed in one corner with an
embroidered quilt folded at the foot of it completes the ensemble.  An
off-white porcelain pitcher and basin are on a small stand near the bed and
some small squares of cloth are on a peg nearby.  The tidy fire pit and
little clay oven are on the opposite wall from the bed.  A finished wood
cabinet is set a bit apart from the oven, and holds plates, pots, a variety
of jars and other necessities.  Four chairs and a #btable#n, sit next to the
door just to the right.  There is a curtained #balcove#n off the back of the
room and large slatted doors leading outside onto a rooftop patio with a
balcony.

alcove~
On closer inspection the alcove reveals a collection of clothing, a plain

holds a few jars, a small bound notebook, a wooden comb, and a tiny
hand-held looking glass.

Done with a black background it simply depicts a large tree in all its
glorious fall colors.  A single small leaf hangs in mid-air as though in the
middle of its journey.

#gWandering through the woods#n~
Grass and small bushes line the forest floor here.  The large oaks,
chestnut and beech trees here are covered with moss.  The light grows a bit
dimmer here as the leaf cover filters through some of both sunlight and
moonlight.  Although woods are in all directions, the trees are spaced
several yards apart, and have grown quite large.  The sounds of nature,
birds, crickets and the like, are a constant here.

Patio~
A small, clean, private patio has been created here above the shop. 
Simple, padded wooden chairs and other furnishings are placed about. 
Hanging plants and brightly painted pottery decorate the area.  An overhang
from the living quarters makes shade during the daytime and shelter during
the rain.  A beautiful wrought-iron balcony extends a bit outward from one
side of the patio so the busy market, or perhaps the moonlit sky at night
can be viewed in privacy.

This is Cordoba's marketplace.  The street widens here so that many
merchants can have the room to set up stalls.  Used by day to hold Cordoba's
large markets, merchants come from far and wide to have a chance to hawk
their wares in this large city.  Many of the buildings around here are used
by the city's craftsmen and guilds.  A small #bsign#n lies hanging to the north
infront of a small shop.

small cots and mattresses.  On the cots are a single blanket and pillow. 
There is a fireplace on the west wall with a woodpile stacked on the hearth.

its way through the woods to the east.

Foyer~
Upon first glance at this room, one can expect its owner to be a person
of the utmost, aristocratic tastes and of meticulous design.  The wooden
landing here, even though slightly worn is polished to a natural gleam and
is also well taken care of.  Stepping up from the landing, one will be
standing on white-marble tiling, each one flawless in their creation. 
Torches behind the doorway alight the walls and domed ceiling, illuminating
craftsmanship that one could call exquisite rather easily.  A domed archway
leads northward, with carved statues of two beautiful women that appear to
hold up the arch itself off the ground.  The statues themselves are part of
the framework, and seem to be little more than creative license of the
designer.  From inside the room to the north filters a deep crimson light,
however faint.

The Dining Room~
This room is incredibly expansive as well as luxurious.  The floor is
made of an elegant, white-marble tiling.  Resting upon it is a large table
where a great many chairs rest next to it, all of it looking very expensive.
Paintings of the sun rising over snow-capped mountains, of the sea at night,
of a forest at midday, and finally of a city at night can be seen hanging
from the stone walls of this place.  There is a cedar cabinet on the western
wall of this room.  The room is constantly lit by a fireplace located behind
a pane of stained glass of similar coloration.  In the northern corner of
this room is a spiraling stairwell, leading up to the second level of the
house.

romantic overture to the room.  To the north is a small set of oaken doors
leading to what is most likely guest rooms.  From the surrounding rooms
wafts a smell, something akin to lilac.

The forest creek empties here into this pond.  The woods stop a few yards
from the water's edge, making for a small beach leading up to the pond. 
Quite wide, this pond is a favorite watering hole for nearly all the
creatures of these woods.  All manner of fish and water fowl inhabit this
pond.  The calm surface of the water reflects the view of the woods
perfectly.

a simple wood desk with a matching chair seated behind it.  The top of the
desk is cluttered with ordered piles of hand-written scribbles as well as
quill pen and an ink well.  To the side is a bookshelf full of rolled up
scrolls and a few badly bound books, most have no titles for they are
personal journals.  The room is lite with a few candles attached to the wall
with simple metals and a few extra chairs are strewn about the small space.

#gDeep within the woods#n~
Grass, mossy logs and dense ferns and other underbrush line the forest
floor here, making the woods difficult to navigate.  The large oaks,
chestnut and beech trees here are covered with moss, and interspaced with
smaller saplings that grow quite close together.  The light grows a bit
dimmer here as the leaf cover filters through both sunlight and moonlight. 
The woods continue as far as the eye can see, in all directions.

The First Room of a Carpenter's House~
The facade of the house is weather worn and rather mundane looking,
common enough to blend in almost with the surrounding buildings of the area
although in better shape - and within the building does not reveal anything
out of the ordinary.  The ground storey of the house of scarcely furnished
and arranged into functional kitchen and working areas.  The kitchen area is
composed mainly of a stone fireplace and chimney around which a series of
pots pans are arrayed, hanging from hooks driven into the wooden beams that
support the building.  There is even a large cauldron for stew and a large
cauldron for washing standing off to the side in one of the corners.  The
working area is made up by a workbench and a shelf with various tools used
for carpentry, along with wood shavings littering the ground around it.

#BA bend in the creek#n~
The small waterway continues flowing from the west, the gully it travels
in gets wider and it turns into a full-fledged creek.  The smaller trees and
underbrush grow close the water as it cuts a path through the woods.  Here
the creek widens and turns southward, deeper into the forest.

The Second Room of a Carpenter's House~
The second room of the house is dedicated to the family who lives here
and while it is almost as scarcely furnished as other room, it does not seem
to lack any of the rudimentary necessities having two large beds placed
behind coarse grey drapes along with an armchair and a rocking chair placed
in front of the stove, which seems connected to the brick chimney leading up
through the roof.  A large closet holds most of the familys belongings such
as clothes along with drawers holding knitting gear and yarn and the likes,
while the rest of the familys belongings can be found in a large wooden
chest resting by a wall.  Other than these though, the familys living den
holds little else but a small wooden #bcabinet#n with richly decorated
doors, offering a touch of decor to the otherwise boring room.

E
cabinet~
The front of the cabinet shows a religious image of a man whose head is
surrounded by a halo, the icon resembling those often found in church,
although with a slight alteration.  The halo behind the slightly bowed head
of the man has been carved and lacquered in such a manner that it seems more
of a disc forming an eclipse over a sunburst.  Worked into the finer details
of the rich carvings one is even able to see the presence of the celestial
sign of Ursa Major.  Behind the doors of the cabinet the religious theme
continues.  Within stands a figuring that can only be Christ carved from
scorched wood, his head bowed and his hands held out to either side with the
palms facing upwards.

The Wild Garden~
The garden itself seems both intimate and impressive, the beauty of the
place as if a work of chance and art born of wilderness as assorted
rosebushes and flowerbeds spontaneously mingle and create patterns so grand
only mother nature could possibly be its artist.  From the back door of the
house, a winding pathway of cobbled stones leads through the savage
paradise, surrounded in parts by richly coloured blooms or in another part
shaded by an old majestic copper beech laden with leaves that softly rustle
whenever a breeze courses through the garden.  In the far end of the garden,
the winding path arches over the middle of a small peanut-shaped pond and
comes to an end at the base of a large and heavy slab of stone engraved with
the coiling form of an asp.

The Underground Lair~
The air of this underground chamber is heavy with incense and scents more
vague of carnal desires fulfilled and darker natures still, the atmosphere
tense and laced through with the musk of reptiles.  A single torch writhes
in a cold draft, casting the shadows into a macabre dance along the sights
of powdered gold and indigo upon the walls, along the dark and foreboding
ceiling with its eclipse and along the ground with its #bmosaic#n of jade
and obsidian tiles.  Arrayed by the #bwalls#n are clay jars standing or
lying down, while a statue of scorched wood stands obscured by shadows in
the far end of the chamber, proud and regal upon a dais.  The #bstatue#n
seems the centre of focus for the chamber and worked into the dais
underneath its gaze rests a stone #bsarcophagus#n covered in hieroglyphs.

E
walls~
Of such a beauty and exquisite craftsmanship, rendered by the hand of an
artist, the walls are graced by magnificent scenes taken from the history of
ancient Egypt.  Scenes depicting the eternal struggle between Set and Horus
bleed into scenes showing the lie of Ra and Osiris that enslaves spirits in
the afterlife.  The scenes chiselled in the stone of the walls are decorated
with a myriad of colours from powdered gold which sparkles in the dim light
to indigo which in the darkness has become rather dark and lustreless, each
laboured into the great design.  Often the scenes are accompanied by columns
of hieroglyphs bespeaking of that ancient time, telling the myth of Egypts
gods along with praises and hymnals to the glory of Set.  
~
E
statue~
Carved and assembled from wood whose surface has been scorched to show a
shade of black as lustreless and bleak as soot, the statue which stands on a
raised dais dominates the chamber decorations.  The statue stands larger
than any man, the details so rich as to make it seem almost alive, proud and
regal in its bearing.  The statue represents the Egyptian God known as
Sutekh the lord of sands and storms, with the body of a man and the head of
the Typhon beast a creature with long square ears and a snout.  The incense
and some of the darker scents of the chamber comes from the statue which
stands covered in blood, beer and flower petals.  
~
E
sarcophagus~
The sarcophagus is made of laboured stone polish smooth enough that the
surface is almost as reflecting as a mirror.  The lid of the sarcophagus is
heavy and fashioned into the semblance of a handsome man with closed eyes, a
pharaohs beard and his arms crossed over his chest.  The sides of the coffin
are riddled with row after row of indigo, crimson and black hieroglyphs of
ancient Egypt most likely heaping curses and maledictions upon any stupid or
daring enough to open it without permission.  
~
E
mosaic~
The mosaic which covers large portions of the ground is made of glazed
tiles as well as a few jade and obsidian ones as well, the design of the
dazzling artwork creating an intricate design of water lilies and lotus
blossoms that are spread as if over the surface of a pond, too numerous to
count.  The pond theme is broken only by a portion of the ground untouched
by the mosaic, the illusion of stones creating a pathway across the pond to
the sarcophagus.

#GA forest clearing#n~
Quite suddenly the forest stops, and a clearing appears.  The dense
treeline stands around this large vaguely circular area like dark sentinals.
Several large rocks and fallen logs are about this area, and the tall grass
and wild flowers of all colors flourish in this oasis of sunlight within the
dimly lit forest.

Main Room~
The small room is simply furnished, appearing to be things that were once
stored away in an attic as they are outdated, however they are immaculately
clean and are in good condition.  The floor has a small woven rug that rests
atop its spotless surface, while a finely carved mirror hangs on one wall. 
A settee rests beneath the mirror and there two chairs that rest on either
side of a small serving table.  A small vase with fresh flowers sits on a
small round table covered with a crochet table cloth that has been centered
perfectly on it, two small dining chairs having been sat under it in an
orderly fashion.  In the far corner rests a another table made of thick
wood, shelving resting on the wall above it with neatly arranged crock ware
and glasses.  A small cupboard next it is used for storing food.  Everything
about the room has been carefully placed to allow freedom of movement and
open feel to what might be otherwise cramped conditions.

Bed Room~
The bedroom is tasteful and furnished much the same as the previous room,
heavy curtains that could easily block any light of day hang from the
windows.  Much like the items in the main room this one is decorated with
things that no one had any further use for.  The bed is the obvious focal
point though it has no grand posts rising from each corner, the six foot
tall carved headboard is truly a site to behold.  The feather mattress has
been recently fluffed and a handmade quilt has been placed on top of it. 
The pillows perfectly lined looking almost as if the distance was measured
between them when they were placed on the bed.  At the foot rest a neatly
folded afghan that matches the quilt.  In the far corner of the room
opposite the bed stands a tall screen that offers the inhabitant privacy
while bathing or dressing as a sort of tub sits in the corner behind it.  A
small table sits on the wall next to the bed a mirror sits atop it while a
chair has been placed next to it.  The items on the table have been arranged
accordingly, the entire look of the house giving the impression that someone
has a pension for neatness.

Bolts of fabrics in high quality embroidery, satins and regal patterns
stack along the side of the room.  Floor to ceiling shelves take up each
corner of the room, boxes and baskets are carefully set on and near them. 
In the center of the shop are comfortable upholstered armchairs placed in a
loose circle around a low round table set with a tiny brazier, incense
wafting up to clear the mind and focus the senses.  The long counter at the
back of the shop displays tidy baskets of oddments, behind which are two
overlapping tapestries that cover the door that leads to the kitchen.

`bA Hidden Chamber `e- `bElysium of Seville`n~
A tall and slim hallway of solid, smooth stone leads from a heavy and
firm door to another, the northern one requiring the movement of bookcases
to exit.  The doors are heavy, dark things, steel covered in sanded and
polished wood.  The walls are dark and warmth comes from them, the wood
still smelling fresh from natural oils.  The floors are carpeted in rich
scarlet, gold and green colours, woven from many coloured threads to form
the thick padding for the otherwise stone ground.  The lighting in the room
is soft and drifts down from a solid iron chandelier bearing no less than
one hundred waxen candles, always burning.  At the northern and southern
doors, massive guards stand, well over six feet, each armed with a
broadsword and dressed in traditional muslim attire.

Tile topped cabinets line the east wall of the Kitchen with a bank of
windows to the herb garden beyond.  A table with 3 chairs sits squarely in
the center of the room.  Just to the left of the door inside the kitchen, is
a small alcove - barely large enough for the single bed and trunk at its
foot.  Built in shelves hold tightly stacked pantry items.  A curtain
separates the alcove from the main area of the kitchen, Stairs curve up into
the corner from the edge of the alcove.

`bElysium of Seville`n~
Moving past through the doors to the heart of the civilized vampiredom is
a large, dignified room.  The bustling of Sevilla's streets is not here, the
cries of the civilians roaming the city, the stressful ambiance, all gone. 
There instead is dark wood, dim light and a smoky atmosphere.  Plants in
mosiac tiled pots are frequently seen amongst the heavy furniture set in the
room.  Upon entering in this, the very soul, the epitome of darkness is, as
many might have suspected, music.  The whole spacious hall is absorbed by
it, all from the many harp, lute and lyre players all sequestered within a
shallow pit.  Heavy framed sofas and chairs, all done in deeply dyed scarlet
red leather are placed in meticulous order among candlelit lamps.  At the
far end of the hall is seen a speaker podium upon a short dias.  On the
northern, western and eastern walls are huge oak doors.

`bPrivate Room `e- `bElysium of Seville`n~
A narrow and sparsely furnished room, its intimate nature brought to life
by dimmed lighting and the rich smell of spice, incense, oils and rich
woods.  The room is heavily carpeted and sounds seem to die easily,
providing evidence that this room is soundproofed.  A number of comfortable
chairs and two divans are spread along the solid stone walls, the glistening
leather of the chairs reflecting in a conservative fashion the soft golden
light given by a few candlelit lamps.  Upon the southern wall is a large
wood door with a rather complex set of bolts keeping it closed from this
side of it.

Warm colors and a few rich fabrics give this room a welcoming atmosphere.
Her sturdy four-poster bed stands against the east wall under tightly
shuttered windows, an inviting nest of soft textured, gem colored pillows
and cushions.  The ceiling high posts lift yards of gauzy fabric to shield
dreamers from bright daylight.  At the foot of the bed is a large beautiful
carved chest made of polished red wood.  At either end of the north wall is
the fireplace in one corner and a tall honey colored wardrobe at the other
corner of the room, the large thick rug patterned with ivy reaches out to a
luxurious couch with handsome cushions.  In the middle of the west wall is
the connecting door to the veranda, a small desk with a high backed chair is
set near small shuttered windows.

The covered veranda is a welcome area of potted trees and plants, with an
ironwork #bbalcony#n along the edge - lovely small garden above the traffic
of the street and a wonderfull view of Cordoba.  Snugged up against the wall
are short round wickerwork tables on either side of the long low couch piled
with cushions.  The comfortable upholstered arm chairs testify this is a
favorite spot to dine, watch the sunset, or enjoy a siesta.  House swallows
swoop and dive from the roof untill the night brings the lovely little bats
with their twisting paths and high pitched squeaks.  To the east is a small
door to the Mistress' Suite, framed by night blooming jasmine twisting over
the door, trailing little scented white stars.

`bStone Cell `e- `bElysium of Seville`n~
This is a tiny, cube shaped room with practically nothing of importance. 
The walls are solid stone and the only door out is of solid, hinged rock. 
There is positively no light in this room whatsoever, and the darkness is an
all encompassing force.  The sound from within the rest of the Elysium is
fully muffled, proving both the door and walls are magnificently solid.

gifts adorn the gorgous laddiswork and granite and it seems as if another is
left daily.  Two large statuettes of a handsome horse, bonnie, stand on
either side of the entrance each carved in perfection.  Off to the side lies
a golden plaque depicting details of the woman's life, goals and dreams as
well as a #Rdedication#n from her family.

Our little hour,how swift it flies 
When poppies flare and lilies smile; 
How soon the fleeting minute dies, 
Leaving us but a little while 
To dream our dream, to sing our song, 
To pick the fruit, to pluck the flower, 
The GodsThey do not give us long, 
One little hour. 
Our little hour,how short it is 
When Love with dew-eyed loveliness 
Raises her lips for ours to kiss 
And dies within our first caress. 
Youth flickers out like wind-blown flame, 
Sweets of to-day to-morrow sour, 
For Time and Death, relentless, claim 
Our little hour. 
Our little hour,how short a time 
To wage our wars, to fan our hates, 
To take our fill of armoured crime, 
To troop our banners, storm the gates. 
Blood on the sword, our eyes blood-red, 
Blind in our puny reign of power, 
Do we forget how soon is sped 
Our little hour? 
Our little hour,how soon it dies: 
How short a time to tell our beads, 
To chant our feeble Litanies, 
To think sweet thoughts, to do good deeds. 
The altar lights grow pale and dim, 
The bells hang silent in the tower 
So passes with the dying hymn 
Our little hour. 
I promise you that while your hour is over Karen. Your memory will remain.

#rGatehouse#n~
The Gatehouse to the Villa of the Aemilianus Family seems to have worn
away.  The walls and the gatehouse seem to have been overtaken by ivy, yet
the black Iron Gate seems to be in well condition.  The inscription in Latin
above the gate, however, has worn away through the onslaught of the ages. 
Beyond the gates is a long path that extends upwards on a slight incline. 
Lining the path are lush trees, and beyond that a vineyard can be seen,
along with a wheat field.  The Villa itself sits atop the hill in the
distance, the white walls and red brick roof bring back a nostalgia of Roman
times, for whom knew them or a glimpse of nobility or the emerging merchant
class.

The ground in the Courtyard seems very well used and trampled down. 
There is no vegetation here, yet for on the sides where terraces have been
built to hold flowers and small trees.  To the west is a wood building for
horses, and a few nays and whinnies can be heard.  To the north, there are a
few columns and an archway, with steps leading up to it.

A Small Cell~
This is a small stone room no larger than a typical jail cell.  In fact,
a jail cell is exactly what the room appears to be due to the massive iron
door, stone walls and no lighting.  There is fresh hay upon the floor,
presumably used for a makeshift bed, and heavy iron chains hang from stone
loops in the walls above the hay.  This is not a pleasant place to find
one's self locked within.

various implements used to clean and take care of horses, along with
saddles, reigns, and bridles.  Also there are various blankets to cover the
horses for the colder winter nights.  At the very end of the stalls, there's
a small doorway, which is locked from the inside.

A Moderate Sized Room~
This is the guest bedroom, which provides an intimate sleeping area for
anyone that is a guest of the estate.  A small wooden table with a white
lace cloth displays various personal items, among them are a vial of perfume
and a small silver brush.  Across the room is a four-post bed with a white
sheer canopy draping about the sides.  Upon the bed is a white spread, and
several oversized goose feather pillows.  On the eastern wall is a bookshelf
filled with books on topics of local interest.  Pushed against the far wall,
a personal sized desk and chair are illuminated by a tiny oil lamp.  When
lit, it gives a subtly warm radiance that seems to never reach the corners
of the room.

A amazingly hand crafted wooden landing here, the floor is polished to a
shine you could see yourself in.  Stepping into the main Foyer you decend
several steps placeing you in the center of the beautifuly designed room.  A
torch adorns each of the walls giveing a warm comofrting glow to the room. 
A curved oak archway opens west into a dimly lit but obviously comfortabley
furnished room.  Maroon red Tapestries flow down from the walls to the floor
with a family crests of jet red Dragons with gold borders.  The room itself
only seems to be a gathering place no furnishings other then the artistic
touches added to the decor catch ones eye.

#rThe Atrium#n~
The Atrium of the Villa seems to give off a sense of Tranquility.  The
shape of the room is in a square, and all around is a walkway about 5 feet
wide.  The walkway is sheltered from the weather by a vaulted ceiling,
however the center of the Atrium is open to the sky.  On every side of the
Atrium are four columns, with a few steps leading into the center of the
atrium, between the second and third columns.  Along the sides of the center
of the Atrium are small terraces with flowers and bushes in them.  Smaller
pathways all converge on a center square where a fountain displays Janus in
an impressive pose, while the fountain itself is made out or rich white
marble.  The Atrium is lit, and heated by braziers.  There are two doorways,
to the north and west, while opened Archways lead to the east and the South.

fireplace.  The fireplace is masterfully crafted with what seems to be oak
wood stained dark red to add to the red theme of the room.  The floor has
been carpeted by a light red rug which has many pictures worked into the
threads of it.  Along the walls are several book shelves with many volumes
of different shapes and sizes.  On the other side of the room winds a Grand
stair case which slops up and around the room to the second level.

The gardens are very breath taking, besides being walled off on all
sides.  However, to the east a small stairway leads to a small landing where
one can overlook the lands that the Villa sits above.  The walls, except for
the stairway and the landing are covered in ivy, and flowers.  The garden
itself is very lush, with a few lemon and orange trees growing in the
corners, and small bushes and flowers growing all over.  A large pool is in
the center, used for swimming or bathing.  There are small stone pathways
through the garden, and a little off from the center is a sizable pond, with
fish swimming in it.  On one side of the pond, are a few trees that would
provide shade in the sun, and shadow during the night.  A few lanterns
hanging over the pathways, and other parts of the gardens.

Upon completeing the journey up the magnificint stair case the room opens
up into a very large Foyer.  More tapestries hang from the walls here giving
a more homey appeal.  The center of the floor here is sunk in slightly with
creative craftsmenship and care to detail.  To the North are large Oak doors
inset with Iron to reinforce it, the door looms before you drawing most of
the attention towards it.  To the east and west are short hallways which
lead to smaller doors, behind these doors lies the guest rooms.

The Servant Quarters are very generous for being the Quarters of the
Servants.  Small beds, each with its own draw curtain are mostly situated
against the Western Wall, while against the Southern is a very large
fireplace, with an iron grating over it.  A large basin for bathing is
tucked away in a corner of the room.  In the center of the room, are a few
large tables, with divans around them, enough to seat twenty or thirty
people.  There are small dressers next to each bed.

Many cutting and cooking utensils hang from small racks, and the smell of
freshly cooked meat still lingers in the air.  There is a small stairway
leading to a door that leads to the wine cellar.

its walls.  The room has no fireplace but the room seems quite warm, several
vents along the walls suggest that the fireplaces in other rooms are vented
to heat the rest of the house as well.

slight square, with an opening on one side.  Surrounding the tables are very
comfortable looking divans, draped in purples, oranges, reds and yellows. 
Upon the walls are various beautiful frescos.  Some of them depict Roman
families, while others depict battles.  The Dinning room is lit and heated
by various braziers.

efficiently lights the entire room.  Tapestries flow from the walls every
one depicting a different picture and family crest.  Above the bed hangs the
tapestrie with the dragon againhanging down to the headboard.  The floor is
polished to a un-natural gleam which seems almost to perfect.  The Bed is
made with A black blanket around the blanket hang red silk bed drapes.  A
wash basin is perfectly carved and placed on a pedestal beside the doors.

No expense was cut short when creating the living room of the Villa. 
Many Divans lay scattered about the large room, and small fountains lay in a
square pattern around the Center of the living room.  However, at the center
is a small fire pit, which is used for heat, and braziers line the wall,
which provide the lighting.  On the floor is a large Fresco of fish jumping
in a river, and on one wall is a fresco of Scipio Africanus leading an army
against Cartage.  Over the windows are purple drapes, and on the various
tables are silver platters laden with figs, olives, oranges, lemons, and
grapes.

The Courtyard~
A large, fenced courtyard stretches out here, offering the O'Finnigan
Estate some degree of seperation from Cordoba proper.  There is a
cobblestone walkway that leads to the front doors of the house, flanked on
either side by a row of hedges, trimmed to about waist height.  The house
itself is on the larger side, but is mostly one-story, with the only
vertical extension being directly centered in the front of the building. 
There are windows throughout the house, with the ones on the second floor
being made of glass.

The small garden provides a nice little relaxation spot after or before
dinner, or when one simply does not want to stay indoors.  Small trees,
which surround the garden, provide shade, and there are benches mostly
around a center square, where wide basin fountain is.  The ground is also
stone, except for small planters filled with flowers and bushes.  Strangely
enough, the Garden is mostly enclosed and a small openings in the ceiling
allow light to filter in.  Several braziers are along the wall, which light
the Small Garden.  There is a Stairwell that leads upwards, the sides
covered in ivy.  Terraces also seem to hang from the high ceiling.

A long and wide entrance hall opens here, with exits stretching off in
each direction.  Along one wall is a large portrait of Sheamus, and along
the opposite is a mirror for guests to use.  There is a fine red carpet on
the ground.  Off to one side, a staircase leads up to a pair of double
doors, bearing Sheamus' personal crest on the center.  The handrails are
ornately carved, one ending in the form of an eagle, the other a lion. 
Built into the side of the staircase is another door, leading to a further
staircase to the basement.  A large chandelier hangs from the ceiling in the
center of the hall.

#rUpper Floor of a Small Garden#n~
The upper levels of the garden are quite the same, except here, the
terraces which contain plants are hanging from the ceiling, which are filled
with bushes, hanging ivy, and flowers.  Also, there is a small walkway,
going around half of the garden and small fountains trickle down from near
the ceiling into lower basins.  On the ground is a fresco of a few fish,
swimming along a stream.  To the south is a pair of large double doors, and
to the east.

The Study~
The hall opens to a small study, perhaps 15 feet a side.  There are
bookcases lining the walls, except for the wall that seperates the study
from the courtyard, which has two large windows and between them, a large
painting of a beautiful seaside cliff.  Opposite the painting, there is a
large fireplace built between bookcases.  The room is furnished with about
half a dozen cozy armchairs and a fairly large table in the center.

#rGuest Quarters#n~
No lavishness was spared when creating the Guest Quarters of the Villa. 
The large double doors open to a pair of heavy thick curtains, which conceal
the Quarters.  Behind the curtains it can be seen that the Guest Quarter is
very large and that the ceiling vaults upwards.  In the middle of the
Southern Wall is a large four poster bed, with ivory silk curtains that
drape down.  To the west is a large fireplace covered with an iron grating. 
The floors are covered in fine Persian rugs, while a large desk is to the
east.  A few divans sit around the center of the room, where a table is.  On
the table is a silver platter filled with grapes, figs, olives, oranges, and
lemons.  Also a few goblets and a pitcher of wine sit on the table.

The Dining Hall~
A large banquet hall stretches out here.  The single largest feature is
the grand table, which seems to have more seats than could possibly be used.
The chairs are wooden, carved simply, with a small cushion on each of them,
except for the one at the head and the ones to either side of it, which are
ornately carved and covered in velvet.  The lighting comes from a chandelier
hanging in the center of the room, and small torch holders in between the
windows.  Each of the side walls is lined with windows.  Along the back
wall, there is a fireplace.  Next to the fireplace is a door leading off to
the kitchen and the servants' chambers.

#rLibrary#n~
The Library of the Villa is gargantuan to say the least.  Rows upon rows
of bookshelves are filled across the room.  Books line the walls, as well as
scrolls, and even a few tables are over laden with them.  Books of all kinds
can be found here, including maps of Spain, Greece, Italy, France, Germany,
Britain, parts of Eastern Europe, the Middle East and North Africa. 
Genealogies of Kings and Emperors can be found, as well as many historical
texts of Empires and Kingdoms.  The floor is covered in a fine Persian
carpet, and to the South is a large window which overlooks the Villa's'
Atrium.  Small braziers are placed around the room, which light and heat it.
The room vaults upwards into a domed ceiling.

The walls are lined with windows and torch holders, which combine with the
rather small chandelier to provide the lighting for the room.  Along the

#rDemodocus' Quarters#n~
The Quarters of Demodocus are decadent, and lavish to say the least. 
Thick purple and red drapes cover the windows that are all over the room, as
well as thick shutters.  The room itself is very large and to the eastern
wall is a large four poster bed, with ivory opaque silk drapes.  The bed
itself is lined with pillows and sheets, although they seem a little
undisturbed as if he slept on top of the blankets and didn't bother getting
underneath them.  Dominating the center of the room is an enormous desk that
is covered with texts, parchments, maps, genealogies of mortals and
Cainites, scroll and several tomes and books.  The floors are covered with
Persian rugs, and a large fireplace dominates the northern wall covered by
an iron grating.  Over to one side of the room is a simple iron staircase
leading upwards.

The Bedroom~
Two grand, ornately carved wooden doors open up into the large bedroom of
the Estate.  The primary fixture is the large four-post bed that takes up
almost an entire wall, with pillows encased in silk and blankets of soft
down.  Overlooking the courtyard are a number of glass windows, creating a
clear view of the courtyard and the town beyond when the drapes are tied
back.  There are thick, elegant crimson drapes with gold lining over the
windows.  The carpeting in this room is soft and plush, and a deep shade of
crimson.  There is a set of double doors leading out to a balcony, which
overlooks the back of the grounds.  There are twin armchairs on the balcony,
fairly comfortable.  Inside the room, there is a large fireplace, and two
large, cushioned armchairs beside it.  Between the chairs there is a small
table, with a pair of wine glasses and a bottle of wine on it.

The Observatory of the Villa is splendid.  Part of it is in closed by a
sizable copula, while a 5-foot walkway surrounds it.  Inside the copula is a
desk with various star charts sitting upon it along with various books and
scrolls.  In small planters situated around the desk are various plants,
many tall and lush looking to be well taken care of.  A set of gardening
tools lie on a small desk behind the larger one.  From the copula and the
walkway, a three hundred sixty-degree panoramic view of the country side can
be seen.

The Wine Cellar~
The basement of the Estate is taken up as a wine cellar.  The occasional
cobweb hangs in the corner, but the distinguishing features of this room are
the rows and rows of wines, some exotic and some quite old, that line the
shelves around and in the room.  Along one wall is a grand set of double
doors, with a guard standing on either side.

The Wine Cellar of the Villa is very cool and slightly damp.  A small
doorway leads up to the kitchen, while a small stairway leads down into the
Cellar.  There are various rows of wine racks, most of them well stocked
with red and white wines.  Along the walls are small open torches to provide
lighting for the cellar if need be, and along one wall Is a faded fresco of
a Roman get together, people laying down on divans drinking and eating,
musicians and a few people dancing.

The Underground Ballroom~
The grand doors open into a large, windowless, candlelit ballroom, much
like the one upstairs only without the windows.  The floor is the same
smooth wood, and there is a large stage along the far wall.  The walls are
rough stone, with occasional pillars carved out of them.  Every so often
there is a small torch holder to provide light, the rest of which comes from
the many small chandeliers hanging from the ceilings.  At the back of the
stage, off to one side, is a large door, with a guard standing at either
side.

To the southwest above the tops of the trees in the distance a bell tower
can be seen.  Crickets chirp occasionally and the sound of birds singing can
be heard.

An Underground Meeting Room~
The door opens into a nice sized meeting room, perhaps the size of a
small tavern.  It has much the feel of an Elysium, with a number of cozy,
padded armchairs, only a few candles along the walls to provide light, and a
number of small tables.  One wall is taken up entirely with bookcases, which
contain many curious readings but even more trinkets of mild interest.  Like
the ballroom, the walls are carved roughly of the local stone.

#pGate to a Monastery#n~
Ivy seems to cover the short stone walls surrounding the yard.  The walls
themselves are made of many small stones stacked upon each other in such a
way as to negate the use of mortar.  A wooden gate hangs from one side of
the wall, mainly used to keep animals in.  The yard itself is divided into
several small areas with roughly built stick fences seperating them.  A few
moderately sized buildings sit in various places around the large yard
serving various different functions.  However it is the building which sits
directly in the center of the yard which the monks here hold in the highest
regard.  With its towering bell tower, stone walls, and small but, none the
less beautiful stained glass windows stands the Monastery itself.

This cozy room appears to be a quaint little potter shop.  The walls are
lined with shelves covered in various objects made of pottery.  Anything
from plain undecorated bowls to brightly painted oil lamps and figurines can
be found here.  The wooden floor has been swept to keep the dirt from the
streets out and the window looking out at the street has been wiped clean of
dust and grime.  There is a wooden counter on the far side of the room
opposite the entrance door with a stick of incense burning in a pottery
bowl.  A plain wooden door is behind the counter in the eastern wall.

Temple~
The trap door leads to stone steps that descend into a long and dark
chamber.  The floor is covered in several inches of sand and the walls are
draped with black curtains which by torchlight reveal numerous embroidered
hieroglyps.  At the far end of the room is a simple stone alter.  Standing
on the alter is a statue of a strange being with a stiff forked tail, a long
gaunt body, a tapering snout, huge erect ears and protruding eyes.  The
statue is 18" tall and appears to be made of onyx.  A plain wooden bowl
rests at the feet of the statue.  Traces of a dark sticky residue line the
inside of the bowl.  The scent of perfume and blood lingers in the air.

of Italica ends here.  Just up ahead the outlines of some low-lying
swellings left over from hundreds of years prior can be seen.  Some large
chucks of stone sit in the plain that Italica is situated in, and the
treelines of the hills thin slightly as the wood moves closer into the small
valley of ruins.

Bedroom~
This room is dominated by a large, comfortable bed with a linen canopy
that is nearly transparent.  Plush red cushions cover most of the floor of
this chamber.  A wooden dresser flanks the bed on one side with a framed,
standing mirror on the other.  Resting upright in the far corner of the room
is a wooden sarcophagus.  The sarcophagus is covered in egyptian hieroglyphs
and a life size depiction of a woman is painted on the lid.  The sarcophagus
appears to be very old and worn making the hieroglyphs difficult to read and
obscuring most of the details of the woman depicted on the lid.  A large
bronze brazier hangs from the ceiling by 3 linked chains and provides ample
light and heat for the room.

not neccessarily loose, lined mostly with small stones, it is actually firm
to foot.  In the Center of the room, is a large table, on which is a few
daggers, and a large carving knife.  Against the walls are odd knick nacks,
a few roots suspend some cloaks, here and there, and on the far wall, there
is a large woolen coat, next to which is a wooden door.

stone buildings that once served as the residences and places of business
for its Roman inhabitants.  Long since abandonded and believed to be
haunted, the only visitors these ruins have are the insects and animals that
now live here.  A trail is noticeable going through the ruins, heading east
and west through Italica.

is taken up by a large chest of sorts, the contents of which certianly
arouse curiousity.  The Cavern certianly has less of a clean feel to it, the
dirt far looser, and the walls lined with roots here and there, as with any
natural cave.

quite easy to see why not a single soul strays into the ruins.  Farther on

A very small, nondescript slum shack.  The walls are covered in filth,
the windows are completely shut over with boards making it VERY dark.  Thick
cobwebs hang from the corners and most of the ways.  A number of small
creatures scutter about, and the few sparse pieces of furniture are nearly
molded through.  If the shack has been used recently, it was not used by
people with a penchant for housekeeping.

behind the counter.  There are rows of shelves upon each wall, each lined
with trinkets and baubles from all over the known world.  It almost looks
more like a museum or showcase than a shop, with each item carefully
selected and displayed by region.

here.  The window up here has a heavy red curtain drawn across it, the ties
to which show evidence that a cat may have been playing with them recently.

#eAn underground chamber#n~
This is a large chamber with a vaulted ceiling.  Large portions of the
floor and walls are still tiled in Roman fashion and there are a few sunken
pits in the middle of the room.  Presumably at one point this was a
bathhouse or storeroom of sorts.  Now, there are bloodstains upon the floor
and bones from a variety of creatures strewn everywhere.  Strangely enough
there are signs of habitation in this large chamber, clothing, personal
items, and a great many tables are neatly arranged here.  Doors to the east
and west are barred shut and fixed with sliding bolts to lock them.

Dining/Kitchen~
This room is only separated by a long counter, which can be easily seen
across when people are standing in the room.  It looks like a simple woman's
kitchen, though the amount of utensils here would indicate that she must be
used to having guests often.  The dining area is mostly taken up by the
wooden table, finely crafted that sits dead center.  There are 6 chairs made
to match the table surrounding it.

Approximately ten feet by ten feet, this cell is very very small.  There
is a chair in the middle of the tiny room affixed with leather straps, but
that is its only furnishing.  No light enters in when the window in the door
is slid shut, just the solitary confinement and lots of cold dark stone.

Bedroom~
Though the bedroom is small, it is more than adequate for one person. 
Though the decorations are simple, there are several fluffy pillows strewn
about the bed for comfort.  The window in this room has dark green curtains
over it, and the walls have been painted with a creeping ivy pattern across
them.  A vanity and a wardrobe, both well made and painted with the same
creeping ivy pattern as the walls, sit across the room in the corner.

#BLa Taza del Rey#n~
The King's Cup is not overly large, yet still very functional.  It still
looks new, and by most standards it is.  A large oak bar, in front of which
multiple stools are set, is nearly always tended.  Each table is covered
with a fine tablecloth, meticulously cleaned, and embroidered with multiple
different flowers.  Against the western wall, a raised pedestal is placed. 
A single, small painting is placed on each wall, besides the one where the
entrance is located.  On the main door, a massive painting is placed
covering it entirely.  The painting is that of a royal crown, set with not
gems, but large golden cups.  Most of the clientele seems to be that of
wealthy foreigners and local nobles, but there are a few less wealthy
patrons.  Eastward is a door, next to which a stair-case leads up to the
guest rooms.

This front room is simply a large office where business can be conducted.
Two desks, more functional than decorative, with several surprisingly
comfortable chairs, are that main adornments within the room.  From the
ceiling hang a few lanterns, which provide light should someone be working
late at night.  A fireplace is set into the east wall, a small couch, two
comfortable sitting chairs, and a small table is facing it.

a large desk, a chair placed behind it.  Multiple sheets of parchment with
financial reports, and other miscellaneous paper work is scattered across
his desk along with quills and pots of ink.  Behind this, a massive painting
with the Inn's insignia and the words El Taza del Rey is placed.  Two other
chairs are placed on the eastern side of the room, and two more on the
western.  A pull-string with a long rope, much like the ones in the private
rooms of the Inn that goes to the Kitchens is placed here.

Warehouse~
A large warehouse, filled with stone and the constant sound of metal on
stone clinks.  It seems instead of clearing the ruins from the property when
they built this large building, they just make sure that none of the rubble
was in the way, and built around.  Areas toward the front are cleared, and
seem to be work areas.  People are chiseling and working stone constantly,
day or night, and rebuilding the wooden walls with stone.  If you look
closely, it appears that on the ground are grid marks for future
construction projects within the large room.  Seeded through out the room
are sleeping mats for the workers, who appear to work and sleep in the same
general area.

Coming up from the Tavern, this hallway is lined with torches, providing
ample light for anyone walking down it.  Paintings also line the hallway,
eight in total.  At the end of it, a painting of a crown, yet instead of
jewels, it is set with golden cups.  Multiple doors are here, each one
leading into a different guest room.  On the ceiling, multiple ropes lead
downstairs towards the kitchens.

plenty of room to expand, in the east side of the room.  The central portion
has a few comfortable chairs, and large table between them all.  The dcor is

tunnel to the south leads to another chamber is seems, where curious and
disturbing sounds emanate from, echoing off the walls.  This room has

A lab maybe.  There is a large table in the middle of room covered in
blood and ichors.  A pen of some sort is in the back, the rooms cut into the
earth, then a door, some thicker than others, barring the way.  Noises, some
more human than others, tend to scream, moan, and in general make their
discomfort known to all who can hear.  Jars are filled with thing best left
unsaid, let alone looked too closely at.  And a stench prevails over the
everything.

art to its finest.  Plush eastern rugs and overstuffed pillows cushion
guests against a shining and waxed hardwood floor.  Clusters of peach
colored upholstered chairs are set in groups to encourage socializing.  A
garland sewn from yards and yards of fabric depicts winding vines with
two-toned roses wending around the upper molding of the stone walls where
they meet the high ceiling.  A silver serving set with a beautiful tray and
serving pieces sits on a carved French sideboard if guests would like
refreshments.  An archway leads to a smaller area where a sculpture is in
progress and faint sounds from the servants and kitchen area at the other
end and an arching doorway marked 'private' is on the immediate right side
of the room.

sides of the alcove that houses the stage.  Piles of huge fluffy pillows
stacked against the walls would act as seating for most, but there are also
three long padded benches shoved up against the walls as well for those not
able to sit upon the floor.  The ceiling is low at the back of the stage and
rises from there to the back of the theater to carry sounds out to the
audience with ease.

along with shoes, gowns and robes.  Off in one corner of the room a lattice
panel separates a large wooden tub from the rest of the room.  A small
alcove with a drawn back curtain reveals a sleeping nook for any servant
that may stay to see to the occupants needs.  Large slatted doors lead out
into a garden area.

private place.  Small wrought iron benches are scattered about and the
tinkling of water can be heard.  Beautiful flowering bushes with fragrant
blossoms crows each other for attention and beds of roses, lavender and
other ground cover plants fill out the area.  Mossy rocks line a small
channel for watering the garden if the rains do not come.  Further back,
into the deepest part of the garden, there is a small rock grotto filled
with clean sparkling water, big enough for three or four people to take a
dip in, but not large enough to swim freely abut the place.  A large tree,
providing shelter over the grotto, has a long low leather divan placed under
it for lounging after a refreshing plunge in the water.

wall serving as torch holders.  Spider webs hang from every which direction
but a pathway leading to the steps seems to be well used and worn as if
someone daily walks on them.

on the library shelves at the eastern end of the room.  The tomb at the
southern end of the room has been broken into.  The door with "Gustovus"
engraved on it, has been ripped off and lies on the floor with the smashed
coffin and bones.  The comfortable couch and the single cot have both been
over turned and obviously thrown to the other end of the room.  On the walls
are faded patches where there were once weapons hanging.  They are no longer
there.  The room is a mess and looks to have been trashed as someone or
something has searched through it.

#yForest Trail#n~
The natural trail winds itself amongst the trees and underbrush.  Small
animals run across it, causing the bushes to shake and rustle.  Bird calls
echo through the forest in the treetops as they fly from tree to tree. 
Dappled light sprinkles itself on the ground causing the shadows to dance
around the tree roots.  Twigs and leaves cover the forest floor, snapping
and crunching when stood on.

#yA Clearing#n~
The forest opens up into a large clearing with a few tree stumps.  There
are flowers growing off to the side and the occasional small animal that
sits at the forest edge.  The clearing is covered in lush mounds of grass
and during the day, butterflies and insects make their way from flower to
flower.  It is a small oasis of light in the middle of the dark forest.  To
the north, set amongst the trees is a roughly-hewn cabin.

with skins and leather wall hangings.  Hanging from the ceiling is a string
of small bones and tusks, that clang together making a musical sound when
touched.  In the middle of the room, stretched out on the floor is a large
bear skin rug.

#BMain Room#n~
A large fireplace monopolizes a great deal of the north wall of this log
cabin.  Over the fire stands a spit and a pot holder for cooking, while next
to it, is a bench covered in cooking ingredients and utensils.  In the
middle of the floor, to the west, stands a large roughly-hewn table and
wooden bench seats.  To the east of the room, sits wide wooden chairs that
have been covered in furs for comfort.  On the floors, pelts and furs have
been spread out, with a large bear skin rug in front of the fire.  Above the
fireplace, a large tapestry has been hung.  It depicts a large silver wolf
sitting on a high rock, howling to the moon.  Near the door are some wooden
pegs jutting out from the wall.  A bow occupies one of them, while the
quiver of arrows rests against the wall below it.  The room has been
tastefully decorated with hanging bone carvings and leatherwork as well as
herbs growing in pots making the log cabin look very homely.

A large stream dances its way over rocks and rends its way through the

jumps out for the insects that hover above.  It disappears amongst some
thick undergrowth to the west, while it flows towards the east, winding its
way to its destination.

The trees and underbrush grow closely together here.  Squashing out the
light that might try to squeeze through the leaves.  It is quiet and dank as
the smell of rotting leaves and waste, fills the air.  The bushes rustle
occasionally as a startled animal darts away to safety.  Bird calls fade in
the distance as they fly through the forest.

It disappears into a dense thicket of underbrush.  It is dark and dank with
the smells of rotting foliage intermingled with the droppings from the

warmth and light of the day and the moonlight of the night.

#yThe Pond Clearing#n~
A forest path leads from the clearing to a more open part of the area.  A
large clear, yet relatively deep pond is surrounded by thick, luscious green
grass.  A variety of flowers grow randomly amongst the grass.  An opening
throughout the canopy of the forest allows the light of the moon or sun to
shine down onto the soft, still, top of the pond.  Gentle sounds of wildlife
stir around the area, along with soft trickling sounds of water over rocks
nearby.  Moving through a small thicket, a turnoff to the pond brings about
a small quiet grove, which is hidden within the forest to the north.

Parting a veil of ivory that hangs from the limbs of the canopy of trees,
a secluded grove off the pond can be seen.  A small stream cascades over
multiple rocks forming a small waterfall into the pond.  About the hidden
grove, several flowers are in bloom and their scent hangs in the air.  The
ground is blanketed with soft grass and mounds of moss in a few places. 
Small sounds can be heard, from a soft song of a bird, to the rustling
leaves from passing animals.  The light seems to glimmer about the hidden
grove, hinting to the peacefulness of the surroundings.

stream.  There are flowers growing off to the side and the occasional small
animal that sits at the forest edge.  The clearing is covered in lush mounds
of grass and during the day, butterflies and insects make their way from
flower to flower.  Light sounds of the stream can be heard all nearby.  It
is a small oasis of light in the middle of the dark forest.  Towards the
west, the trees and brush are showing signs of scorching from a fire.  Their
blackened branches and trunks stretch out towards the pile of ash that once
was a cabin.

Hanging from the ceiling of this modest spice shop are small bundles of
dried herbs such as rosemary, sage, mint, and cilantro.  Two scarred and
abused tables sit parallel to one another in the middle of the shop, each
bearing various small sacks and jars to properly display the wares.  Chief
among these aromatic containers are dried dill, sweet basil, sesame seeds,
anise, satureja, cumin, bay leaves, and fennel.  The cloying scent of garlic
permeates the air nearest the simple wooden counter, where strings of the
dried bulbs hang lifelessly.  On one side of the counter sits a shelf carved
out of the wall itself, this one holding various pastilles of incense such
as rosewood, sandalwood, myrrh, and frankincense.  Sitting upon this shelf
as well are three clay jars, the words "pepper", "salt", and "cinnamon"
having been scrawled in spanish to indicate the more expensive spices hidden
within.  To the north and behind the counter lies a wooden door, leading
into the back.

#eA Quaint Dwelling#n~
From the shop to the south, you've entered into what would seem to be a
small office of sorts, coupled with the moderate comforts of living, and
lacking any sign of a window at all.  On the eastern wall is a small wooden
desk, holding rolls of parchment, while on the western wall is a rather
comfortable looking bed, laden with more than just a few soft cushions, and
made with sheets of fine linen.  Each corner of the room is hung with a
shaded lantern, spreading a dim glow about the area, enough light by which
to read or write, though not so much as to disturb a person caught within
the peace of sleep.  Dropping down from the ceiling just next to the bed is
a bronze censer, quite ornate looking as it bears the image of two serpents,
which intertwine together, each head sprouting from a different side with
opened mouth, which allows for a dual wisp of subtle and scented smoke to
escape, shedding the fragrance of jasmine, a luxury that does nothing but
help to further the relaxing atmosphere that is quite abundant.  Covering
the wooden floor is a large, crimson and cream persian rug.

#eA Root Cellar#n~
There is nothing out of the ordinary about this storage room.  Along all
four walls are bags of assorted spices and various herbs, all organized to
be found with ease, and labelled for the same.  The length of each wall has
been carved into something that would serve as a shelf, and even those are
lined with clay jars and a variety of smaller sacks, the extra supplies for
the store that lies above, along with a few of the more rare and
hard-to-find goods.  Bundles of drying herbs dangle from the thick wooden
beams holding the shop aloft, each giving off its own unique aroma and
adding to the cloying atmosphere of the simple storage area.  Setting off to
the side as the only break in the line of bags, is a small bed, accompanied
by a wooden table sitting just next to it.  This is, most likely, also where
the person running the shop is bound to be sleeping at.

This is an elaborately decorated main hall, though somewhat small for a
nobleman's it seems perfectally lovely.  At the northern wall there is a set
of stairs going up with a decoratively carved railing, at the base of the
stairs there is a door going north, a room for the servants of the house. 
By the stairs is a well-made couch with pale blue upholstry, which has an
elegantly carved wooden table a few feet in front of it.  Situated opposite
of the couch to the table are a pair of pale blue upholstered chairs.  To
the west is a large oaken door, with two windows, one on each side of the
door, which is the same case with the eastern door.  To the south, however,
is a simple oaken door.

In the dining room there is, as expected, a large rectangular wooden
dining table in the center.  Around it are spaces for eight chairs, though
there are usually no more than are necessary for the meal.  Along the
western wall there are three windows, and on the southern wall there is a
small fireplace, with a couple of paintings hanging on the wall as well.  To
the west is the kitchen, from which the hustle and bustle sounds and sweet
smells of food preparation can be heard and smelled near meal-time, as well
as the door back to the main room to the north.

sweet smells wafting from the windows to the kitchen from the south.  In the

is a window looking out on the streets of Cordoba.  Opposite of that window
on the wall is another window, looking out over the lovely garden.

A rumble of sound spills forth as you enter the wide main room of the
Singing Siren.  Conversations cluster around tables stretched across the
dim, somewhat smoky room often interrupted by the clinking of glasses and
plates.  A long bar spans the eastern wall, lined by a row of tall stools. 
Tall posts disrupt the flow of the room, thinning to the west where the
scarred wooden floor lifts in a riser of worn planking, sparely lit by
torches.  In a back corner set safely apart from the tables, the outline of
a throwing board appears on the wall, the surrounding wood chipped from the
impact of knives over the years.  Murals and tapestries hang along the
walls, providing pleasant decoration for the patrons of the tavern.  To the
south is a door with a sign above it, reading '#PSeamstress shop#n'

On the back wall, several well-crafted embroidered quilts hang in view to

an assortment of tunics and breeches hanging.  A small counter separates the
back area of the shop to where she stores clothing to be mended on and other
items.  Behind the counter, different pieces of materials can be seen for
the start of a new creation.

The floor is covered by a brown carpet.

next to it.  A small wardrobe cabinet rests a wall and the window shows the
streets of Cordoba.

#rContinuing Balcony#n~
The balcony continues on to a dead end here.  At the end of the balcony
is a large, white marble statue of the muse of tragedy, Melpomene, from
Greek mythology.  She is wearing a crown of cypress and holding the mask of
tragedy in one hand and a sword in the other.  The floor is lined with the
same dark red carpet covering the rest of the balcony floor, and the wall is
adorned with a few, brightly colored tapestries and paintings.  A door to
the north leads to the master bedroom while the hallway continues back to
the west and towards the stairs.

#rMaster Bedroom#n~
This room appears to be the master bedroom.  The same ebony hardwood
floor that adorns the rest of the house is duplicated here.  A large
rectangular rug, bright with red and black roses intertwined is on the
floor.  The walls are done up in a dark wood paneling, intertwined roses
making up the molding.  A large four post bed is pressed against the far
wall, covered in silken red and black sheets and pillows.  An enormous dark
wood armoire is taking up almost the entire space of the eastern wall.  The
doors are engraved with large diamond designs.  There is one small window in
the room, set behind the bed.  A door to the south leads out into the
hallway.

Entryway~
Coming in from the street, there stands a decently appointed greeting
room.  Thick rugs of varying quality cover the floor in a patchwork pattern,
mostly in shades of brown or green deep, dark, natural colors.  None of
these rugs are anything too elaborate.  A massive hearth takes up the center
of the room, accessible from all sides and surrounded completely by a circle
of polished grey stone.  A circle of low couches surrounds this hearth, each
one large enough for three and inviting, both in design and in comfort.  At
the far side of the hearth, opposite the door, stands a massive chair, build
of solid wood and thickly, lavishly padded, it hugs the boarder between
chair and throne.  The walls, crafted of wood of somewhat less imperious
quality, are insulated by layers of dense but nondescript tapestries, most
depicting simple floral patterns, though the one behind the chair reads: No
bird soars too high, that soars with his own wings, in Arabic.

Kennel~
Pushing aside the Arabic-inscribed tapestry, there is a simple
wrought-iron spiral staircase down, each piece forge-blackened to stave off
rust.  At the bottom, there is simply a cavern of unworked stone, stretching
off into the gloom beyond.  Beginning about halfway down the corridor which
is perhaps thirty feet to the wall to either side, and easily thrice that
distance long there are massive cages, each one crafted of heavy steel and
stacked only two high.  Growls can be heard from some, snoring from others. 
The rattling of a heavy chain can be heard from the shadows to the west.

Workshop~
The heart of the beast, as it were.  Here, far below ground and hidden
away, there stands an immense workshop.  The room is lit by a series of
small candelabras all over the walls.  The room is long but narrow, so that
the light from the piles of candles is enough to illuminate it completely. 
It contains row upon row of tables, each ones with various implements piled
on them, everything from manacles to short, razor-sharp curved knives.  The
devices look like a combination of medical tools and torture devices, with
more than one ambiguously straddling the line.  Smears of dried blood are
caked in the crevasses of some of these tables more than not, in fact.  The
grating of a heavy chain can be heard from within the distant reaches of
this room, as well.  It seems to be coming from the back, where an immense
crate, perhaps six feet by four by three, stands on a raised platform.

The Kitchen~
The kitchen is sparse, and shows signs of disuse, as though this house
has not seen company in some time.  A heavy table, obviously meant for both
food preparation and eating, takes up most of it.  Crafted of heavy
hardwood, it is a proper table on which to butcher, prepare, and serve an
animal.  A few plain but solidly built chairs are clustered around the
farther end, in a way that suggests they would be spread out were there
serving to be done.  A door in the back leads outside into a small courtyard
in the back, where a cooking pit and its serving woodpiles dominate.

#yA Humble Alehouse#n~
As you set foot into this small tavern, the first thing one might notice
is the atmosphere of the place, not being one of rowdy words and drunken
brawls,but one of tranquility and relaxation.  The patrons who frequent this
place are not those who have come in hopes of drowning their sorrow and pain
in the sanctuary of an ale-filled mug, but rather, those who have taken
refuge in this cozy haven for the evening, in order to bring ease to muscles
which have worked in the midst of fields for most of the day.  A long wooden
counter can be seen running near the entire length of the eastern wall, and
behind it are more than a few barrels, each filled with the ale that is the
source of profit for this cozy drinking hall.  Hanging all about this place
are a variety of small lanterns, each giving off a dim glow, which helps to
further increase the overall sense of lull that this environment is quick to
bring upon a person.  The only noticeable means of service at all are a
rather large and rotund man who keeps vigil behind the bar, as well as a
serving wench, whom is not hard on the eyes at all, even if looking a bit
haggard from her long night's work of catering to those townsfolk who serve
as her hard working and faithful neighbors.
