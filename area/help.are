Xterm256 colors can be accessed with the ^^ symbol.

The predefined xterm colors are:

   n: no colour (switches colour off)
 
   r: ^rdark red^n                        R: ^Rlight red^n
   g: ^gdark green^n                      G: ^Glight green^n
   b: ^bdark blue^n                       B: ^Blight blue^n
   y: ^ydark yellow^n                     Y: ^Ylight yellow^n
   m: ^mdark magenta^n                    M: ^Mlight magenta^n
   c: ^cdark cyan^n                       C: ^Clight cyan^n
   w: ^wdark white^n                      W: ^Wlight white^n
 
   a: ^adark azure^n                      A: ^Alight azure^n
   j: ^jdark jade^n                       J: ^Jlight jade^n
   l: ^ldark lime^n                       L: ^Llight lime^n
   o: ^odark orange^n                     O: ^Obright orange^n
   p: ^pdark pink^n                       P: ^Plight pink^n
   t: ^tdark tan^n                        T: ^Tlight tan^n
   v: ^vdark violet^n                     V: ^Vlight violet^n
 
 So for example "This is ^^Oorange^^n." will colour the word "orange".  You 
 can add more colours yourself just by updating the switch statement.
 
 It's also possible to explicitly specify an RGB value, by including the four 
 character colour sequence (as used by ColourRGB) within square brackets, eg:
 
    This is a ^^[F010]very dark green foreground^^n.

#n Innocence Lost RPI#y -#n HELP DATABASE
#g--------------------------------------------------------------------------------#n
The taxi system allows players to get from point A to point B at a quick and
typically precise rate, but with the cost of cab fare. 
#n
For simplicity's sake, all cab fares are 10 dollars. 
#n
Not everywhere on the map can be driven directly to by a taxi cab. There are
many locations, hideaways, easter eggs and simply not taxi-able places that
need to be explored, located and either walked to on foot or driven to in a
personal vehicle #g(help vehicle)#n.
#n
#GSyntax:#n

~ 0 PREGNANCY BREED~
#g--------------------------------------------------------------------------------#n
#n Innocence Lost RPI#y -#n HELP DATABASE
#g--------------------------------------------------------------------------------#n
#GSystem Summary and Rules#n
#n
The pregnancy code exists to track generational lines and realistically
address the biological complexity of physical relationships. In layman's
terms, if you're roleplaying sex, fading it to black or otherwise, the breed
command must be used without exception.
#n
Staff take no stance on mudsex one way or the other. Adults have sex; it's a
reasonable expectation that at some point our players will write it into 
their relationships. Write about whatever you like, but please use the 
appropriate command(s)!
#n
Birth control and condoms are coded into the game and should be purchased and
used prior to entering the breed command if contraceptives are roleplayed. An
assumed use of "phantom" contraceptives is against the rules, and not accepted
as a reason why the breed command wasn't used.
#n
The characters created as a result of pregnancy can be used by either mother
or father as an NPC; their pfiles should be given descriptions and roomdescs
prior to joining roleplay. Children are allowed into the same scenes as the
parent puppeting them; we do not consider child pfiles to count as multiplay.
#n
The Lost greatly celebrate and revere the incredibly rare child born to their
kind; while the code acknowledges the near-impossible chances of a Changeling
being able to conceive, it can (in legendarily rare circumstances) be done.
#n
#gNote(s):#n The breed command does not need to be used for same-sex couples, as
its purpose is to check for pregnancy. Coded pregnancy lasts approximately
four real life months. 
#n
#GCommands:#n
#n
#wbreed <name> #g-- #nStarts a behind-the-scenes roll for pregnancy.
#wuse <item>   #g-- #nAdds the "contraceptive" affect to the person that used the
                item. Must be used before "breed" to work. When breed is used,
                the affect is removed. Contraceptives are single-use.
#wbirth <name> #g--#n When you go into labour you will be prompted. Birth will
                create a pfile with the name you choose, and genes based upon
                mom and dad. To set their password, log in with their name and
                enter a password when prompted.
#n
#RDo not use the breed command on anyone as a joke, as an OOC mechanic or in any
situation where roleplay has not necessitated it.#n
#g--------------------------------------------------------------------------------#n
~ 0 PATHFIND PATHFINDING~
#g--------------------------------------------------------------------------------#n
#n Innocence Lost RPI#y -#n HELP DATABASE
#g--------------------------------------------------------------------------------#n
The pathfinding code maps out directions from your present location to a
targeted individual. This is of especial importance to the visually impaired,
and offered as an alternative to the ascii map (help map) code.
#n
The pathfinding output is extremely simple, and this is was purposeful design
choice. Screenreaders should be able to report the directions required to get
to anyone currently logged into the game. 
#n
Check "where" to see a list of players who are online, make sure they are in a
place you would like your character to join, and work your pathfinding magic!

~ 0 CASINO SLOT SLOTS~

#n Innocence Lost RPI#y -#n HELP DATABASE

Our slot machines have ten possible results in each roll: cherry, plum,
grape, watermelon, orange, lemon, bar, double bar, triple bar, or seven. 
Getting three of the same results in a row (this counts diagonally,
horizontally, or vertically) wins.  The amount you win from that particular
result depends on what it is, the result calculations are as follows:
#x
#RCHERRY#n (any) (any)  - Win your bet + 1/4 (horizontally only).
#RCHERRY CHERRY#n (any) - Win your bet + 1/2 (horizontally only).

~ 0 MONEY CURRENCY WORTH PAYCHEQUE~
#g--------------------------------------------------------------------------------#n
#n Innocence Lost RPI#y -#n HELP DATABASE
#g--------------------------------------------------------------------------------#n
The currency system involves the use of pounds to pay for whatever your
character might want or need. On Penny Dreadful, your weekly paycheque
directly reflects your rating in the Resources Merit. 
#n
You will not automatically collect a paycheque -- when your timer expires, you
will receive a notification (if you are online at the time) stating that you
can collect again. Inactive characters do not automatically collect paycheques
and stockpile money while away; you must be online and enter the command to 
collect your weekly funds.
#n
Your money is used to purchase items, order drinks, pay for cabs (pending) and
contend with a potentially endless list of uses.  
#n
You can give money to other people with the "give" command, just like with
items.

Changelings with the Harvest Merit may also use the code to regain a number
of Glamour points equal to their rating in Harvest per day.

#g--------------------------------------------------------------------------------#n
#n Innocence Lost RPI#y -#n HELP DATABASE
#g--------------------------------------------------------------------------------#n
One of the most potent tools a Changeling has at their disposal is the
collection and use of Goblin Fruit. Fruits may be foraged from the Hedge
with the proper skill set -- a Changeling must know what they're looking
for and still succeed in locating the proper fruit or herb.
#n
Changelings may forage for Goblin Fruit twice per day (this is code enforced).

#g--------------------------------------------------------------------------------#n
Changelings and Ensorcelled characters cannot use modern implements in the
Hedge. As such, they have developed a means of contacting one another via
long-distances without leaving the Hedge; the rats of the London Underground
are well-trained and recognize the Lost for what they are. In exchange for a
pittance in Glamour (occasionally in exchange for future favors or a moment's
attention) the hedge rats will deliver items or notes to other Hedge-dwelling
individuals.

#g--------------------------------------------------------------------------------#n
#n Innocence Lost RPI#y -#n HELP DATABASE
#g--------------------------------------------------------------------------------#n
Sneaking and hiding are both mundane aspects of the Stealth Skill. Hide has a
lower threshold for success, and allows the Stealth user to remain still and
hidden in a single room. Sneak requires a higher success threshold, and allows
the Stealth user to move from room to room without alerting others to their
arrival or presence.
#n
Stealth and Hide are both automatically contested by others. If you have 
entered "look" you have already rolled to contest the stealth success of any
hidden individual. Sneak is contested by others when you first enter the
room with them. 
#n
#GSyntax:#n

#g--------------------------------------------------------------------------------#n
#n Innocence Lost RPI#y -#n HELP DATABASE

Lockpicking allows characters with the Larceny Skill to pick and open locked
doors. A roll is performed behind the scenes (Dexterity + Larceny), and with
a minimum number of successes, the lock will open. Lockpicking can only be
performed once every 30 seconds. Picking locks is an In-Character act, and is
of course illegal. Take into account where you are before picking a lock;
Staff may drop a policeman onto your head in the right (wrong?) circumstances.

The spy and scan commands, while related, have two moderately different uses.
Spy is considered to be an IC mechanic (and rolls behind the scenes each time
it is used to determine the success your character has), and has a range of
several rooms from your character. Scan is a take on the classic scan command,
which displays only those in your character's immediate vicinity (and requires
no roll).
#n
#GSyntax:#n

#g--------------------------------------------------------------------------------#n
#GGENERAL STANDARDS#n

#g1.#n Staff may not take any action which affects their character alts, up to and
including handling their own purchase requests or issuing weekly XP.

#g2.#n You will not be able to make everyone happy. Don't try to. Do what is best
for the overall population. On your Staff account(s), you are to be neutral 
and courteous at all times. 

#g3.#n Do not champion any game-related cause from your Staff account if it has 
any connection or perceived connection to your alt(s). Your influence as Staff
cannot be used to support your personal playstyle or character goals. Use your
player account to express opinions of that nature. This applies to the MUD, 
forum, and wiki talk pages. 

#g4.#n You are required to be intimately familiar with the House Rules and abide
by them. 

#g5.#n Staff may have alts in Court Monarch positions only if there are no players
interested in the role. Players are not expected to unseat you; when the 
situation arises that a player could fill the Monarch position, you are 
expected to come up with and execute a viable exit strategy. Go into any IC 
leadership role aware that it will be temporary. 

#g6.#n Give everyone the benefit of the doubt. Patience, understanding and 
compromise are essential; if it doesn't violate a rule, you have no authority
over it. Forward gray areas to Merry. 

#g7.#n There will always be somebody that just rubs you wrong. Always be ready to
give yourself an offline time-out to cool down, and ask another Staff member 
to handle potentially contentious situations with them.

#g8.#n Check the request board when you log in. If there is something on there
that you can handle, do so. 

#g9.#n Absolutely no information that you gain as a Staff member is to be leaked
beyond Staff channels.

#g10.#n The "snoop" and "log" commands are disabled for a reason. We do not spy on
players. Do not ever enter the IC grid on your Staff account while invisible. 

#GCHANNEL DECORUM#n

#g1.#n The Story channel is not an outlet for venting poison about players. Keep 
it positive and constructive, or don't say it at all. 

#g2.#n Staff are not to swear over OOC or hnet. Do not engage in arguments with 
players over any public or private channel. 

#g3.#n If you're online and visible, you will monitor and handle request channel
needs.

Welcome to Innocence Lost, a Chronicles of Darkness RPI-lite!

The first thing you should be aware of is the #wADVICE#n channel. Trolling or funny
answers are not permitted over #wADVICE#n; you will always get a serious, legitimate
answer to your questions. To speak over #wADVICE#n, use: #gadvice How do I...?#n

All monitoring Staff may be contacted with the #wREQUEST#n command. To contact the
Staff, use: #grequest I'm stuck!#n

Our website and Wiki are located at #wlishmud.com#n and #wlishmud.com/wiki#n. We strive
to keep the in-game helpfiles up to date, but if you cannot locate something in
a helpfile, the Wiki is always a good next step.

We are not an application-based RPI. You do not need to wait for Staff to review
your character before entering play. Once you have progressed through in-game
character generation, you are able to enter the game and begin play.

Note that we do not have mobs to kill or automated quests. The sole purpose of
the game is roleplay. Combat is carried out with our d10 dice roller, and
descriptive #wposes#n #g(help pose)#n.

We are not a consent-based MUD, and death is permanent.

Please let Staff know if you need help, have an idea for improvement, or simply
want a little guidance. We are happy to help!

#g--------------------------------------------------------------------------------#n
Character death on Innocence Lost is always final. Characters who die are 
forever dead and cannot be rehashed, reclassed, or otherwise brought back from
the afterlife. Your consent is not required for your character to die. It is
unfortunately necessary to note that revenge characters are easy to sniff out
and will be removed from play.

In the World of Darkness death is a vital element. Regardless, character death
tends to be rare.

#r|#G OOC Channel#g:#n The OOC channel is a not-oft filtered mode of communication.   #r|#n
#r|#n The Administration may on occasion request that certain topics be dropped   #r|#n
#r|#n or that open disputes between players cease, but for the most part there is #r|#n
#r|#n an "anything goes" attitude that we strive to maintain on PD. As a result,  #r|#n
#r|#n content frequently strays into what some may find offensive. Some players   #r|#n
#r|#n choose to keep their OOC channel turned off to avoid viewing what they      #r|#n
#r|#n find objectionable. To turn your OOC channel off, type channel -ooc and     #r|#n
#r|#n -omote.                                                                     #r|#n

#r|#G Adult Content#g:#n Penny Dreadful MUD is for adult participants only. Many      #r|#n
#r|#n In-Character scenarios are alarming or offensive.                           #r|#n
#r|#n                                                                             #r|#n
#r|#n Though you certainly have the option to log out of Penny at any time,       #r|#n
#r|#n you may not opt out of story arcs or In-Character situations you object to  #r|#n
#r|#n on an OOC (or IC for that matter) basis. This means that anything can       #r|#n
#r|#n happen to your character, it does #Rnot#n mean that you have to actively        #r|#n
#r|#n participate in a pose-by-pose roleplay scene describing it. A Fade to Black #r|#n
#r|#n (FtB) is perfectly acceptable to handle disturbing or otherwise             #r|#n
#r|#n objectionable In-Character moments if one or more players are uncomfortable #r|#n
#r|#n with the content. By Fading to Black, it will be discussed OOCly what       #r|#n
#r|#n happened, rather than written out descriptively In-Character.               #r|#n
#r|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------#r|#n
#r|#G Harassment#g:#n On Penny Dreadful MUD we define harassment as repeated          #r|#n
#r|#n attempts, successful or otherwise, to contact a player after he or she has  #r|#n
#r|#n made it clear he does not wish to be contacted by a certain individual. If  #r|#n
#r|#n a player has OOCly told you to leave them alone and you persist, you are    #r|#n
#r|#n harassing that player.                                                      #r|#n
#r|#n                                                                             #r|#n
#r|#n In-Character interactions between players are an entirely separate affair   #r|#n
#r|#n from their OOC relationship. Unless the Storytellers have reason to suspect #r|#n
#r|#n a player is using their OOC dislike of a player to influence their In-      #r|#n
#r|#n Character behavior toward them, there is no such thing as "In-Character     #r|#n
#r|#n harassment." Do not report that a maniac is ICly stalking you around the    #r|#n
#r|#n city and you want him to stop. That is not harassment, it is roleplay.      #r|#n
#r|#n                                                                             #r|#n
#r|#n If you are being harassed please keep a screenshot of your interactions     #r|#n
#r|#n with the offender and submit it in a PM to Merry on the community forums.   #r|#n
#r|#n Behavior of the OOCly harassing variety almost without fail results in the  #r|#n
#r|#n offending player being permanently banned from Penny Dreadful.              #r|#n

#eAll the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players:
#eThey have their exits and their entrances; 
#eand one man in his time plays many parts, his acts being seven ages. 
#eAs, first the infant, mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.
#eAnd then the whining school-boy, with his satchel and shining morning face, 
#ecreeping like snail unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
#eSighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad made to his mistress' eyebrow. 
#eThen a soldier, full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,
#eJealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel, seeking the bubble reputation
#eEven in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice, in fair round belly 
#ewith good capon lined, with eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
#eFull of wise saws and modern instances; and so he plays his part. 
#eThe sixth age shifts into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,
#eWith spectacles on nose and pouch on side, his youthful hose, well saved, 
#ea world too wide for his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,
#eTurning again toward childish treble, pipes and whistles in his sound. 
#eLast scene of all, rhat ends this strange eventful history, is second

#g|#n XP if we haven't read a pose from the character. Players are encouraged to  #g|#n
#g|#n add a note to the end of the recommended pose to explain why they liked it, #g|#n
#g|#n but it is not required.                                                     #g|#n

#g|#n writing - the best in that scene offered by the player. Do not recommend    #g|#n
#g|#n one-liners for the sake of recommending. The player will not earn XP for it.#g|#n
#g|#n It is also very frowned upon to simply recommend the first pose a player    #g|#n
#g|#n writes in a scene. Wait until the end of the scene and select the best pose,#g|#n
#g|#n don't just get recommending out of the way because you're too lazy to take  #g|#n
#g|#n some time after the scene to find the best (and most likely to get max XP)  #g|#n

#g|#n XP is rewarded for recommendations every Friday. Individual poses earn from #g|#n
#g|#n 2 to 4 XP. The top three recommendations earned by your character that week #g|#n
#g|#n are added up, and the XP doled out. For example, players submitted 5 recs   #g|#n
#g|#n for Jaime this week. The first pose earned 2 XP, the second 3, the third 2, #g|#n
#g|#n the fourth 3, and the fifth 4. The top three poses are worth 3, 3, and 4,   #g|#n
#g\#n which means Jaime earns a total of 10 XP that week.                         #g/
