Oli Lainey The culmination of the movie ends back where it started: Heathrow Airport in London, couples and friends, families and acquaintances seeing one another as they exit the arrivals hall -- those moments of sheer bliss and relief. 'All You Need is Love' plays under the posh accent of the narrator. Lainey couldn't possibly be more relaxed by the time the credits roll; one might be forgiven for assuming the film itself was her 'happy place.' Distraction settles in fairly fast, however; lips have no sooner grazed fair flesh than her eyes half-lid and body draws still. Her hand squeezes his wrist.
Beaumont Oli The expression is clear in that brief moment. The kindly old bulldog looks at Beaumont with a look of pure rage. Like the eyes of a man lost to his fury upon seeing a the killer his spouse. Pure and unadulterated hate, the look of a man who means to kill. The look is gone hidden expertly by a mask, however the mask is just as clear to Beaumont. The kind smile and distracted words are little more than just that, a mask. "Oh Yes, Mansfield. Forgive me for not being familiar with yourself but the name is well known. Does a relative of yours hold a Seat in the House of Lords?" He enquires as he pulls a pair of glasses from his inner jacket pocket. They are slid over tired looking eyes, the faded tattoo of a cross on the corner of his eye now hidden. "Well Im afraid my Brother is quite ill at the moment and I was just coming to gather up a few things at his home. However I do have a moment to talk, as my car has not arrived to pick me up just yet." He says glancing up towards the street behind him.
Lainey Oli The Devil keeps watching the movie, taking note of the girl's eyes tearing up. He takes a moment to hold her a little tighter, Maybe just to remind her that he is still here. He doesn't move from that grip untill the moment has passed and her composure is restored. As Colin Firths character comes across the screen Oli perks up. "Bloke looks like Beau." The words are muttered under his breath.
Patrick Imogen A bantam lass with curly, sunny blonde hair doesn't just shut the doors, but slams them. A whole gaggle of seagulls that had been mindlessly perched on the railing take flight in panic. This arguably seems to offend her more; their flapping wings and noisome calls refresh her ire; she flings open the window and yells up at the retreating birds: "PISS OFF!" Naturally, they had already been 'pissing off.' Flat, unreadable eyes watch their ascent until they're wholly out of view; only then does she seem satisfied. The window shuts the second she steps away from it. Bare legs fold in bandy angles over the couch at Patrick's side. "What's that?" is wondered of the bag. 
Imogen Patrick The sight of her ire refreshed by the seagulls causes the Ogre's eyes to dance, clearly pleased by the sight of it in a way no one had any true right to be. "Fookin birds, 'ey?" The question is posed to her with a conspiratorial tone that belies just a small hint of hunger in his eyes. "Perchin where they don' belong. Probably even covered the deck in shite while they were at it." He grunts disgustedly at the very thought of that last before looking from her back to the bag in his hand. The brown paper is given a tug open and from within it he produces a foil wrapped pasty, all hot and everything. Or at least enough so to leave the crinkled wrapping warm to the touch. 
Cal Dinah "How doth the little crocodile," muses the Irishwoman, her shadows shifting as she speaks, coalescing into plump lips that move over each syllable. Her fingers tap idly on the glass she ordered, setting it back across the bar before her. Her voice tapers off and she lapses back into silence, studying the bartender.
Oli Beau A brief look from Beaumont spies the thumbs up flashed his way from the window and his gaze turns back to the fetch. The card is viewed and turned over in one hand, studying it for a time before finally pocketing it for the time being. "I will keep that in mind, Mister Crocker. I am certain that I could open up my schedule for a chance to speak with you privately on the matter." The words trail off with the very same polite smile he'd given the man before flashed his way before he adds, "My condolences on your brother. I will see to it that I do not bother you with business again until your brother has gotten better or your fears have been confirmed. Good evening to you." And with that, he'd linger just long enough to waste a few more moments of the man's time as he checks his watch once more before making to stride off.
Michael Antoni A tall, red-haired man with green eyes nods. "Well, not as much as I'd like, man. Its good to see you again." He says, a cincere smile still on his face. "How have you been?" He says as he puts a hand on Michael's shoulder, his eyes glowing blue for a second. (I like the small nod to his Lost heritage in the emote)
