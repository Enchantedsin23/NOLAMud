Traffic flows north and south across the six lanes of the bridge, and
tourists from all over the world stop to take pictures along the walkways
that line the bridge.  Through the fog, patches of the bay below can
sometimes be visible.  Every now and then a loud fog horn from cargo ship
passing below can be heard.  Continuing south, the bright lights of the city

Traffic slows as it gets closer to the toll booths.  All vehicles
entering the city must pay a five dollar toll, as the sign reads. 
Thankfully though, leaving San Francisco is free.  Past the toll booths, the
101 splits, taking different courses through the city.

Here the wide freeway separates, taking two different routes through the
city.  19th Avenue begins to the west, going through the Presidio and then
south into the city.  To the east, 101 continues parallel to the bay and
heading towards the marina area.

strtegically placed at the head of the bay during the Second World War.  Old
concrete bunkers set into hill can be seen from the street, as well as the
sprawling base headquarters and barracks.  The entire Presidio was vacated
long ago and turned into a historical park.

sailboats reaching far enough off the water level to be seen from the
street.  To the south, the large Divisidero Street begins.

Bright flourescent lights line the ceiling of this tunnel, illuminating
what the headlights from the cars do not.  Traffic flows north and south
through this tunnel.  The walls are tiled, though it has been quite a while
since the city repaired them, as much of it is cracking off or rusted from
the salt water fog that seeps in.  A few of the lights flicker on and off,
running on their last bit of juice before burning out.

their dogs heading into the park despite the late hour and chilly weather.

Grassy hills rise on either side of 19th Avenue as the street winds its
way through the large Golden Gate Park and its small hills and dips. 
Judging by the thickness of the fog in that direction, the bay is out to the
west.  The rest of San Francisco lies off to the south and the east.  19th
Avenue continues to make its way through the park, eventually leaving it
farther south.

Here, 19th Avenue climbs at an almost forty degree angle up one of the
steep hills that San Francisco is so famous for.  Those few souls brave
enough to scale this hill on foot move very slow indeed.  At the very crest
of the hill the entire city can be seen stretching in all directions,
expanding below in a sea of twinkling lights.

coming and leaving the city.  The Bayside gas station is to the north, the
bay and thick fog overlaying it is visible behind the structure.  To the
east the boulevard continues, while west takes one to the Golden Gate
bridge.

smaller private sailboats.  The moonlight glints off the water's surface
before being swallowed by the thick fog farther out from the harbor.  The

eventually the Golden Gate lie off to the west.

As Marin boulevard curves south, the bay falls out of view.  Here, the
boulevard turns into Bay Street, which leads eastward and eventually ends on
The Embarcadero and its various wharfs.  There is less traffic on this
street, though it is still brightly lit by the many streetlights on the
sidewalks.

by a cold bay breeze.

a homeless man curled up in a doorway can be heard.  The cars which go
through this intersection seem to bear little or no regard to the law, as
those cars running red lights are far too common.

tall hills which loom to the south.  A cold wind blows down the street,
sending newspaper and a variety of other trash swirling into the air.  A
couple of people stagger down the sidewalk, most likely returning home from
a bar.  Brightly colored, pastel buildings line both sides of the steep
street, spaced so close that their walls come flush up against the next
building.

newspaper and a variety of other trash swirling into the air.  Brightly
colored, pastel houses and stores line both sides of the steep street, with
a parking garage interjected every few blocks.

both directions for quite some distance.  A small alleyway opens up on the
western side of the street.

Francisco, The Embarcadero, forming a T-juncture.  The coast can be seen not
far to the east, along with several large piers and brightly lit ships.  The
sparse crowds on Bay Street become much larger on The Embarcadero as people
wander about seeing the sights, or visiting the various restorants and shops
along the famous boulevard.

italian restaurants begin to crop up as North Beach, the city's
predominantly italian section, begins.  To the south, Grant Avenue continues

Grant Avenue cuts right through the North Beach area of the city here. 
North Beach is the Italian section of San Francisco, and lining the streets
are various places of business which can attest to that.  Delis, cafes,
restaurants and tourist shops make up the majority of North Beach.  And
despite the nighttime hour, there are still many people walking down the
sidewalks, and many stores that are still open.

Lombard Street heads east-west through San Francisco.  Parked cars line
both sides of the streets, their wheels turned towards the curb in case
their emergency brakes go out, sending the vehicle careening down the steep
incline.  A few delivery trucks drive along the street, heading towards
their late night and early morning delivery routes.  A little ways to the
west is the most famous section of Lombard Street, known as "the crookedest
street in the world".

Here Lombard Street angles downwards, having reached the crest of the
hill.  For a short distance, the street switches from blacktop to red
cobblestones, obviously kept in good condition all year-round.  The street
swerves drastically from side to side, thus getting its famous title as "the
crookedest street in the world".  Elegant apartments and homes line this
section of Lombard, and many cars filled with tourists drive down the hill,
forced to go no faster than 15 mph due to the windiness of the narrow
street.

#yLombard Street#n~
Lombard Street heads east-west through San Francisco.  Parked cars line
both sides of the streets, their wheels turned towards the curb in case
their emergency brakes go out, sending the vehicle careening down the steep
incline.  A few delivery trucks drive along the street, heading towards
their late night and early morning delivery routes.  A little ways further
to the east is the most famous section of Lombard Street, known as "the
crookedest street in the world".

#yIntersection of Lombard and Van Ness#n~
Van Ness Avenue runs north-south through this intersection, while Lombard
Street runs east-west.  The street is very wide here, as wide as some
highways, and with just as much traffic.  A streetlight flickers and several
people stagger drunkenly down the sidewalk, shouting for some unknown
reason.  Buildings of all sorts loom above the wide streets as they cross
each other, each one continuing on in all directions for quite some
distance.

#yIntersection of Divisidero and Lombard#n~
Here the streets of Divisidero and Lombard intersect, with Divisidero
continuing north-south, and Lombard running to the east.  A few pedestrians
quickly hurry across the street before the traffic light changes back to
green.  Somewhere in the distance the siren of some emergency vehicle whine
on into the night.

Divisidero Street cuts strait south through the city.  Traffic flies
across its wide lanes, slowing only for the occasional bus or police car.  A
taxi cab pulls away from some curb, steam rising up from the sewer grate the
cab was previously covering.  This street is quite brightly lit, thus
driving off most panhandlers, but the occasional homeless person sleeping in
a doorway can still be spotted.  To the north is the 101, while Divisidero
continues on to the south.

#eTwilight#C Cafe#n~
This small cafe is obviously in stark contrast to the feverish motion of
the dancefloor.  Held in reverie by clear soundproof doors, the cafe is
quaint, and features several japanese amenities.  A fully stocked bar can be
found to the east, built of bamboo as to add to the asian feel.  Smaller
Japanese-tea tables are littered about the room, each one surrounded by
traditional sitting pillows.  The walls are hung with cloth-white trappings,
and each is etched with curious Katakana.

A Drab, Grey Corridor~
This room does little to accent the asian theme of the club, and rather
suits a more serious purpose.  A winding metal staircase curves to reveal
the full span of the corridor, which spans nearly thirty feet long.  The
walls themselves are made of stone, with lustrous metal bolts to hold them
in place.  The hall, lit by intermittant lamps, ends at a metal sliding
door, which is sealed by a card-key lock.

The dark night is displayed in it's fullest glory outside, cut and shred
by hundreads of lights that blaze across the ebon of the midnight sky.  This
long prominade is riddled with couches, obviously seen as a calming respite
from the intensity of the club itself.  The deck is placed upon a rolling
dirt hill, that arches downwards into the city proper.  Two guards stand
upon the deck, each carrying light black machine pistols.

#rThe VIP Chamber#n~
The wealthy and extravegant patrons of this club are often not ones of
low status within society, and those that frequent this room are often
within the upper tier of wealth.  A heavy industrial feel surrounds this
entire room, as silver fixtures and metal statues are littered about.  A
large bar to the east of the south entrance is fully stocked with the most
oppulent of beverages.  Couches are strewn about the room, each reflecting
the stylish technological industrial feel of this current room.  A large row
of slanted bay windows allows vision to the dance floor, which is apparently
directly below this room.  One of these windows, the far left one, can be
opened, allowing one to stray unto the maintenance catwalk.  It seems that
there are few exits to this room: A metal door to the south, opperated by
keypad, and a large mahogany one to the south which is currently under guard
by two burly bouncers.  #R(OOC: This room is an Elysium, and standard rules

#eThe Catwalk#n~
This precarious catwalk is perched high above the hedonists dancing
below, and serves to maintenance the building's interior structure.  Large
laser emitters stream carefully calculated bursts unto the crowd, strumming
along to the beat of the heavy rave music, which is orginiating from massive
wall-mounted speakers.  This is hard to carefully analyze of course, as the
catwalk's rickety structure shakes with every step upon it.  The weak steel
wiresthat hold the catwalk are suspended high above your head, and the only
exit, save a two-story plunge, would be an openable window to the south.

#pSan Francisco Chantry#n-#pEntrance#n~
The Tremere of such a city have replaced elegance with funcionality in
the wake of the rampaging hordes of Cathayans that they have been charged to
hold.  This echoes heavilly in their architecture.  Cemented stone walls
seem to dive down into the black of this hidden chantry, lit dimly by
intermittant lamps on the ceiling.  A large metal staircase paves a path
below, to the chantry proper.  This path is unfortunetly cut short by a
large splitting steel door, which can obviously be locked and barred from
the other side.

#pSan Francisco Chantry#n-#pThe Vault#n~
This large vault, entered either by the large bar-lockable splitting door
that leads to the surface, or by the metal preassure doors to the north, is
made to obviously withstand a direct assault by any foe.  Acting as both the
storage area and chantry proper, this large room, which at one point acted
as a secret bomb-shelter.  Large silver bunk-beds line the west wall, each
obviously designed to house the city's kindred in an emergency.  Within the
middle of the room tables sit, each with computers and maps strewn about
them.  Upon the eastern wall, large stores of vitae, enclosed in metal
barrels, acts as the emergency stores for those lucky enough to take shelter
here in the event of a catastrophic event.  Adjacent to these are sets of
blue ammo-lockers, which each contain a national-guard issue M1A4 Assault
Rifle and a box of spare clips, numbering in three per locker.  The pressure
door to the north is another curious oddity, apparently opened only by a
small metal terminal, which apparently scan the sanguinary DNA of a cainite
by means of a small barbed palmpad on top of it.  All of this, plus that the
room is obviously made at least twenty feet under the concrete foundation of
Club Trancendenz, make this the most formidable haven in the city.

#pSan Francisco Chantry#n-#pThe Interior#n~
The interior is comprised of several linking hallways, enclosed by a
sealing hydrolic preassure door that is made of nearly fiveteen inch think
steel.  The rooms lack life support, as the ideal visitors have little need
for such things.  Grated light-bulbs are built into the thick cement of the
walls, reminiscent of 50's era bomb shelters.  The room seems to revolve
around a large chamber, encased in smokey plexi-glass.  If one was to peer
close enough, it would be possible to view the makings of an elaborate
server room, filled with large sarcophogai of mainframe towers.  An entrance
may be found to the north, as a heavy sealed glass door allows access.

server towers hum quietly in this room, where specially tiled floors reduce
static and massive refrigeration units cool the room to a balmy
fourty-degrees farenheit.  The room is surrounded by a massive glass
barrier, limiting access to a heavy glass door to the south.  Within this
room there is a single computer terminal, marked by a small tag as

them, and is marked by the same tag designation.

#pSan Francisco Chantry#n-#nThe Archives#n~
This entire room is dedicated to the sole purpose of maintaining the
well-being of the chantry's rare hardcopies; works of litterature of an
occult and dangerous nature that are kept in near mint condition in their
original form.  The ground is tiled in white, and glaring flourescent lights
radiate down onto the glimmering floor.  The old bookcases of the middle
ages have been replaced by high-tech steel cases, each entombed in
preasurized plastic to ensure the protection of such works of art.  There
are nearly fourteen of these cases, with the majority of them lined against
the walls.  A heavy glass door allows one to leave this room, and return
into the interior.

Beneath the Cemetary~
These catacombs were probably originally used by the Romans at one point
to bury their dead, but now they lie empty.  Signs of recent expansion are
evident by the coloring of some of the newer tunnels and the remenants of a
few mining tools.  A few places on the walls are streaked with small
rivulettes of water, and dripping can be heard echoing through the
catacombs.  From time to time you also think you hear the echoing of
footsteps, but you can not be sure, as the walls distort almost all sound.

A small but elegant garden is lending a deep, lingering fragrance to the
air.  Colors are strewn about in no particular fashion around the short path
to the house.  Daffodils, bluebells, daylilies and hyacinth color the scene
with their respective yellow, blue, orange and white hues.  Two small trees
display the large pink blossoms of the trumpet flower.  And two large
foxglove bushes presenting their gorgeous purple pigment sit before the ivy
covered front of the house.  The northern door is the main entrance of the
house.

This is a reception area upon first entering the house.  It opens up
grandly to reveal a large winding staircase, stripped with a thin, dark red
carpet, leading up to the second level of the house were a balcony and two
doors next to one another can be seen.  The dark ebony, hardwood floors are
perfectly polished and reflect the image of the two marble benches that are
set in the room.  A door to the west leads to the dining room, while a door
to the east leads to the parlor.  A door to the south leads out towards the
garden.

This appears to be a modest and inviting room in which to meet and
entertain guests.  The floor is made of a dark ebony hardwood and it
accentuates the black stained oak furniture that is carefully placed around
the room for conversation.  The walls hold assorted decadent and brilliantly
colored tapestries portraying beautifully rendered pastoral scenes.  A few
small, square windows allow a bit of light into the room.  An unlit stone
fireplace is set against the northern wall facing a large gothic sofa,
ornately carved with roses and cushioned with a dark red cushion.  The door
to the west leads out into the vestibule.  A small, circular iron staircase
leading down into the studio is in the southern corner.

and shade.  Crushed egg shells can be seen scattered around the room
suggesting that a lot of the tempera mixing goes on right here.  Assorted
bristled and hard brushes and utensils for painting are set on a waist high
shelf near the easel.  Wood panels of every size and shape leans against the
southern wall waiting to be adorned with paints.  An iron staircase leads up
into the parlor.  A thick, wooden door is set on the eastern wall and is
locked tightly.

A large courtyard~
Through a massive iron gate and wooden doors lies a beautiful, albeit
unkempt inner courtyard, filled with overgrown flora and a few fruit and nut
trees, also overgrown.  From this side, it is clear that the function of the
gate to allow the doors to remain open, allowing a view outside the
property, while still keeping the courtyard closed off from unwanted
visitors.  The architecture of the courtyard is very eye-catching with
beautiful arched windows and mosaic tile above the doorways, but it is plain
that it has not been maintained in quite some time, and the finer points are
dimmed down by mild disrepair.  Structured in the same style as the great
villas in Iberia, the manor itself is open and airy, even sporting a
lattice-arch tunnel laden in overgrown, heavy blossoming rose vines that
stretches from one side of the grass bordering the stone walkway to the
other, leading up to the main entrance of the dwelling.

The Parlor~
Through heavy oak doors delicately engraved with lattice-work rose vines
lies the entrance to the villa's sitting room.  An elegant persian carpet
lies across the tiled floor, providing an insulator for what warmth there is
in the room.  A low-lying table sits at the center of a semi-circle of small
couches and luxoriously padded chairs.  Several wall sconces hold large
candles to provide lighting, all of which are burned out and bear the mark
of unuse by a thin sheen of dust.  An oversized fireplace set into the east
wall dominates the room's adornments, standing nearly tall enough for a
fully grown man to enter, and extending two feet back into the dark stone. 
The large mantle of the fireplace is done in the purest white marble, and
carved into it are the visages of several beautiful and angelic beings with
faces expressing various stages of emotion.

The Dining Hall~
This hall is quite spacious, built to seat a large number of dinner
guests.  The floor is tiled intricately in obvious Moorish style, bearing
lapis lazuli stone interladen with pale yellow marble in spiraling designs. 
A steel chandelier hangs from a thick beam in the ceiling and holds scores
of long burned out candles, which would have likely provided more than
sufficient lighting for the entire expanse of the room.  A long banquet
table is placed in the center of the hall and many finely crafted chairs sit
around it, all bearing a thin layer of dust.  Another white marble fireplace
with angelic faces carved into it is placed on the northern side of the
hall, directly behind the head of the table.  Hallways branch to the north
and south, while a magnificently crafted staircase leads upwards.

A hallway inside the villa~
This hallway is quite plain, with a few thick glass sconces holding
burned out candles lining the walls at the shoulder level to provide
lighting when necessary, as the hallway is devoid of any windows to allow
for natural illumination.  A long rug covers the center of the floor, and a
single door opens up to the east.

A Small Library~
The first thing noticable about this library is the multitudes of
bookshelves, rows after rows lining almost every inch of all four walls. 
One large table forms a small island in the middle of the room, large
extravagant chairs tucked against it.  Upon the table, inkwells and
feathered quills idly await to be used, along with stacks of new parchments
both new and old.  Two separate candelabra would light the area from the
opposite sides of the room, were the candles within them not burned down to
the quick.  Each and every shelf in the room lies completely and totally
empty.

The floor in the kitchens are solid stone, so as to minimize risk of
fire.  A row of stoves and sinks line the far wall underneath a large
shuttered windows.  A thick table sits in the center of the room, serving as
the main counter, aided by several other smaller tables placed against the
walls.  A couple of wide stone ledges near the stoves serve as sleeping
space, likely for apparantly missing servants.  A wooden trapdoor leads down
into the small basement that serves as the wine cellar, pantry, and storage
space for the villa.

Set apart from the main structure of the villa, though still within the
property's walls, this small house is just one large hall divided by many
tall wooden partitions.  About two dozen beds are here, along with a large
table and several chairs meant for dining usage.  A locked cabinet stands at
the end of the hall, housing weapons for use by guards.  Complete with a few
small fireplaces this hall allows the servants luxuries far beyond the norm.

stables are rather clean, it's plain they haven't been accessed or used for
horses or the like for quite some time by the lack of oats, hay or

This large and expansive room with absolutely no windows, plainly
recognizable as the master bedroom of the estate.  Two twin oil lamps cast a
soft glow about the room when lit, allowing only the corners to remain deep
within shadow.  A massive four post bed rests in the center of the room. 
Deep scarlet bed linens and sheer cloth hanging from the canopy of the bed
seem to be the only color of the room besides that of the red oak from which
the bed and private desk are made.  The fragrance of fresh flowers gently
drifts through the air from an ever upkept basket of cloyingly scented
blossoms set upon the desk, likely cut from the courtyard surrounding the
villa.

The hall here turns towards the east, revealing the long hallway that
runs along here.  Doors lie every few yards, leading into the rooms. 
Candles have been places high up on either side of the wall, casting this
entire hallway in an eerie, amber glow and causing some of the shadows to
flicker.  The first room of the Moondancer Inn is located directly to the
north while the other rooms lie further down the hallway to the east.

An extensive hallway constricted by the doors that branch off to either
side every so many feet is detailed here in a chillingly dim light.  The
lumbered walls flicker an amber hue as the candles that cling to them
present an uncanny glow that bounces about the hallway and defies the
comforting nature presented by mostly every other aspect of the inn.  The
entrances into the rooms themselves that lead both north and south are large
wooden constructs of a stunning craft.  Each door baring the design of a
wolf howling to a moon far beyond their stand, etched in thick black streaks
that present a rather unsettling visage.

This is the southern most tip of Cordoba, on opposite side of the
Guadalquivir river as the rest of the city.  The city walls can be seen
looming around the river to the north, and to the south where the city gate
is.  The road is wide, well paved and well travelled.  It leads to the north
across the Roman Bridge, while southward lies the city wall and southern
gate.  The Calahorra Fort stands guard over the road and the city of Cordoba
on the east side of the road, and a path leads westward to the Cordoba
cemetary.

Calahorra Fort, the city of Cordoba is north along this road and the
Mezquita, Cordoba's cathedral-mosque, can be seen from along this bridge.

traditional Moorish architecture.  To the east you can see docks extending
into the river, and there is a steady flow of traffic between them and the
market to the north.

Elaborate fountains are placed at all corners of this large area.  A large
covered well stands at the center of the square for Cordoba's inhabitants to
draw water if they don't feel like walking down to the river.  Tall columns
connected by the traditional Moorish archways stand at the northern end of
the town square, and have been used most recently by the city's Christian
conquerers to hang heretics and criminals from.  The Mezquita can be seen to
the west, Cordoba's market is north of the square, and the Calle
Guadalquivir stretches off to the east.

Directly ahead stands the Mezquita.  Before the Christian re-conquering
of the city it served as the largest Mosque in Cordoba.  Now it has been
converted into a cathedral and is the main center of Christian worship in
Cordoba, though most of the city's inhabitants still refer to it as a
mosque.  The Mezquita is a low lying building, in the tradition of most
mosques in Iberia.  Though it is hardly spectacular, its placement on a hill
overlooking the Guadalquivir river makes it a monument that is hard to miss.

#yCalle Guadalquivir#n~
As you continue on the vast expanse of road, you begin to notice the real
beauty of the city around you.  Large constructs of stone archways and grey
tiles seem to be trend for each and every building, yet each has certain
unique qualities.  Brightly colored glass adorns windows that are easily ten
feet off the ground, and even the hovels seem to be festive in comparison to
the slums just a stone's throw away.  Straw curtains are drawn across
doorways, and occasionally a way eye will peer out at you before
disappearing within.  In the distance, the bells of the Christian Church
clang, calling people to mass in order to confess sins and be burdened with
guilt.  To the east you can spot the beginnings of the ruins of Cordoba, and
west will return you to the center of Cordoba. To the south is a moderately
sized abode with a `gsign`n above the door in delicately scripted Spanish.

the small part of the Juderia that can be seen, it appears quite a clean

The Red Tavern, this place can hardly be called a tavern, it so doesn't
fit the common image of a dirty alehouse.  This room is large and sports a
floor tiled in the most red and polished stones, from whence it takes its
name.  An equally polished mohagony bar takes up half the north wall, but
this room resembles more of an elegant salon from a noble's estate than an
Inn.  Visited by the most rich of merchants and out of town visitors this
place is the finest upkeep, from the tables and chairs to the large roaring
stone fireplace to the well-dressed servants that wait on every beck and
call.  Above the fireplace hangs an obviously new #rpainting#n of an
amazingly beautiful woman.  A hallway opens up to the east leading to a

painting~
Where once shreds of a ruined masterpiece hung, and before that a
painting of an extremely beautiful women resided, now hangs the image of a
goddess.  The artist seems to have taken the natural beauty of this
wonderously gorgeous red-headed woman and added to it so perfectly that she
seems to have transcended nature and taken on properties that are just not
possible to possess.  She sits upon the edge of a bed, though the room
around her is distant and vague bringing her more clearly to the front of
the painting.  She is smiling and looks away as if half amused and a bit
embarrassed, caught in a moment of vulnerability almost.  She holds in her
hand a single red rose which is draped across her lap with its' petals
cradled, almost sensually in one hand.  Her dress appears luminescent as it
reflects the light of some unseen source.  Delicate feet dangle from the bed

support such a being.  The artist has left the painting unsigned, but this
is certainly the work of a true artisan.

#yCalle Rojo#n~
Red Street, named so for the rust-colored cobblestones which make up the
road in this part of Cordoba, runs from the marketplace all the way to the
west gate.  Calle Rojo is a much narrower street than those of the bustling
southern end of Cordoba, and winds lazily through shops and homes.  Like
most other parts of the city, the Calle Rojo area always has some activity,
no matter the time of day or night.  Calle de Santa Maria begins to the east
while Calle Rojo continues on westward towards one of the city gates.  A
large gate to the north leads to a large library.

#yCalle Guadalquivir#n~
As you continue on the vast expanse of road, you begin to notice the real
beauty of the city around you.  Large constructs of stone archways and grey
tiles seem to be trend for each and every building, yet each has certain
unique qualities.  Brightly colored glass adorns windows that are easily ten
feet off the ground, and even the hovels seem to be festive in comparison to
the slums just a stone's throw away.  Straw curtains are drawn across
doorways, and occasionally a way eye will peer out at you before
disappearing within.  In the distance, the bells of the Christian Church
clang, calling people to mass in order to confess sins and be burdened with
guilt.  To the east you can spot the beginnings of the ruins of Cordoba, and
west will return you to the center of Cordoba.  You notice a run down tavern
to the north.

#yLa Taberna Guadalquivir#n~
A small one room tavern, the Taberba Guadalquivir is frequented by those
from the less desirable areas of Cordoba.  A dusty bar runs the length of
the west wall, a few barrels stand up behind the bar, presumably filled with
ale or the famous Guadalquivir mead.  Several tables are set up about the
place and rickety chairs are placed haphazardly around.  The questionable
furniture seems to match the equally shady clientele.

#yNearing the ruins#n~
Calle Guadalquivir winds to a close here as the paved cobblestones become
more and more sparse, and the buildings and houses fall into greater
disrepair.  Up ahead are the ruins of Cordoba, either ancient stone
buildings left over from the era of Roman rule or buildings of some
significance to the Moors that were razed when the Castillians took the city
some years ago.

#yRuins of Cordoba#n~
The street is hardly paved at all in this section of Cordoba, and rubble
blocks off several small alleyways.  Most of the buildings are either
reduced to piles of rubble or are missing walls or roofs.  Some of these
ruins have been here for hundreds of years and date back to the Roman era,
but most are simply the remnants of libraries, mosques or homes that were
razed more recently when the Christian forces conquered the city.

#yRuins of an ancient coliseum#n~
Spread out across an immense area stand the ruins of an ancient coliseum.
Although now it only stands over two stories tall, this aged construction's
seating once reached far above the height of most buildings in Cordoba now. 
Some of the seating is still left, the steps leading to them covered by
moss.  The amphitheater looks down into the dilapitated sunken pit of a
stage where gladiators and animals once fought.  This coliseum was used
hundreds and hundreds of years ago by the Romans for purposes of
entertainment.  Today, it is just another neglected crumbling piece of
stone.

Hidden behind rubble, both real and illusory, is a thick metal door with
a sliding pannel about eye level.  Through this panel the guard standing at
the other side can make sure that only vampires or those allowed to pass may
enter.  The small chamber on the other side of the door serves only as an
antechamber.  Lined with steel and always manned by a ghouled guard this
chamber is quite secure and leads southward into the Elysium.

#eA Secret Elysium#n~
This Elysium was set up by the Prince of Cordoba as a place where
friendly meetings and gatherings of Cainites may occur.  As large as the
inside of a moderately sized tavern, the Elysium is equipped with several
tables and high-backed, cusioned chairs.  A few benches stand near the walls
and a raised dias is placed at the far end of the room.  There are no
fireplaces or candles in the Elysium, and the walls and ceiling are
constructed of a combination of stone blocks and metallic coverings.  The
stone just over the entrance is cracked and broken as if something large
crashed into it.  The only light coming into the room is from the moon
streaming through the wide slits in the ceiling.  A door opens to the west
to a private room.  A large #rpainting#n, six feet by nine feet covers one

La Puerta Oeste, the West Gate, is a massive combination of both a wooden
gate and a heavy iron portcullis.  On either sides of the gates on both the
ground and set high atop the city walls are guard houses and towers. 
Although left open even during the night this gate is constantly manned by
armed knights of the Crown of Castile.

All around you small houses of refuse wood and brown plaster are built,
giving the impression of cancers on the skin of Cordoba.  Although the
standard of living here is much greater than that of the deeper slums, it is
still barely fit for human inhabitance.  Northward a ways you can see better
built homes and well kept streets.  The line between the slums and the rest
of Cordoba is almost as easy to see as the shore of a river.  The new
Christian inhabitants use the slums as a way to further degredate the Muslim
population, and there are almost always guards posted along Calle
Guadalquivir where it turns south towards the slums.

You are within the most squalid and poor parts of Cordoba.  A far cry
from the arches, mosiacs and Moorish artistry found elsewhere in the city,
the predominant decoration in this quarter is brown plaster.  Almost every
building here is covered in it, although they are all in severe need of
repair.  The plaster is cracked and faded, and huge areas of it are missing
in places, revealing the poor craftsmenship of the wooden frames.  The roads
are potch marked, with nearly as many gaps as cobbles, and in most places
garbage and human refuse piles up beneath windows and outside doors.  The
few alleys that can be seen reek of urine and other trash.  From time to
time a shout can be heard from one of the tenaments, or footsteps break the
monotonous sound of chittering rats.

Although once known by another name when Cordoba was under Moorish rule
and the seat of the mighty Caliphate, the Christian conquerer's have renamed
it after one of their most important saints.  Bearing such an important name
this area of Cordoba has become home to some of the more powerful knights
and nobles of Castile that have settled in the city.  Many of the mighty
walled villas, newly constructed stone houses and large construction
projects seem to be in contrast with most of the Moorish architecture found
elsewhere in Cordoba.  The Calle Rojo is west of here, while Calle de Santa

#yCalle de Santa Maria#n~
Although once known by another name when Cordoba was under Moorish rule
and the seat of the mighty Caliphate, the Christian conquerer's have renamed
it after one of their most important saints.  Bearing such an important name
this area of Cordoba has become home to some of the more powerful knights
and nobles of Castile that have settled in the city.  Many of the mighty
walled villas, newly constructed stone houses and large construction
projects seem to be in contrast with most of the Moorish architecture found
elsewhere in Cordoba.  There is a large manor to the south.

the fortress is used as living quarters for the current Castillian ruler of
Cordoba.

#yLa Calle des Cruzados#n~
The Street of the Crusaders is named for the Castillian knights who made
a stand in this area of Cordoba after breeching the city walls while
outnumbered by the Moors and awaiting reinforcements.  Though the story is
of legend to Cordoba's Christians, this area has not been repaired much
since the days of that epic battle.  Though the walls are of course solid,
the houses and buildings in this area could use a white washing.  The street
is as narrow here as in the Jewish Quarter, thankfully it is paved just as
well.  Calle de Santa Maria is north of here and the Crusader's Street
continues southward.  To the east is a little shop, the sign shows a jewery
box, a spool of thread, and a pair of sissors.

#yEntering La Juderia#n~
This is the entrance to La Juderia, the Jewish Quarter.  Seperated from
the rest of the city's populace the Jews were given their own section of the
city during Cordoba's period of Moorish rule.  The street seems to narrow as
it grows closer to the Juderia, and some of the buildings lack the fine
whitewashed look that those in other parts of the city possess.  Still, from
the small part of the Juderia that can be seen, it appears quite a clean
area.

#yNearing La Puerta Este#n~
On the street of the crusaders, most buildings could stand some
rennovation, and apparently that is just what the owner of the western
building has done.  The solid stone walls are white washed and the two story
building has several businesses occupying it.  A stairway leads up to the
second floor, where the red lamp burning outside leaves no doubt as to what
kind of business it houses.  Any question is settled by the scantily clad
ladies who beckon to travelers entering the eastern gate of the city as they
lounge by the large windows.  The ground floor, if it is a business shows no
signs of what it might be, but the stairs leading down to the basement are
overhung by a sign reading 'Scriptorium' carved in the wood.

the south from ruins of the reconquista.  To the west seems to be a modest
courtyard of sorts leading to the hospital, while to the east stands a busy
taberna.

#yLa Puerta Este#n~
La Puerta Este, the East Gate, is smaller then the western and southern
gates of Cordoba.  Used mainly for travellers and the populace of the city,
neither the street nor the gate was made for high traffic.  As with the
other gates it is left open most of the time, and stationed with knights of
Castile, though the guardhouses are smaller and the number of stationed
knights are significantly fewer.

This is the main road into and out of Cordoba.  Paved with large

dozen carts side-by-side, this road leads north into the city and southward
out of the city.  The Calahorra Fort is north of here and the southern gate
is to the south.  The smell of horses, manure and hay radiates from the
stable area to the west.

La Puerta del Sur, the South Gate, is a massive combination of both a

both the ground and set high atop the city walls are guard houses and
towers.  Although left open even during the night this gate is constantly
manned by armed knights of the Crown of Castile.  To the west, a #psign#n
hangs just above an open door of a barn.

This is a large grove of orange trees.  Planted before the mosque in the
days of the Cordoba Caliphate, the trees were left even after the Christian
reconquest of the city.  Four large, low-lying fountains stand about this
the grassy area which was used for the ritual foot-washing of the Muslim
religion.  An ornate paved walkway leads up to the Mezquita.

#wWithin the Mezquita#e - #C(#wHoly Ground#e:#w 4#C)#n~
Done in traditional style of Moorish architecture, the inside of
Cordoba's cathedral-mosque seems larger than the outside.  The long building
has cloumns that help to hold up the high ceiling.  Although the conquering
Castillians left the Mezquita in place, they did convert it into a
cathedral, which required some structural modifications.  Makeshift pews
have been built the length of the long building, and most of the archways
that made the mosque an open airy structure have been bricked off to form
chapels to the Catholic saints, and confessionals.  An altar has also been
set up at the far end of the mosque, finishing the job of the conversion and
succeeding in transforming the once bright and open building into the more
cloistered place of worship preferred by Christians.

This is the bottom of the tower called the minaret.  Hidden behind a

not much to see in this dark area.  A wooden staircase leads upwards many
feet to the top of the tower and west is a small door leading to the living 
quarters of the priests.

Above the rooftops of houses and buildings is the very top of the
minaret.  A circular tower that stands many feet above even the roof of the
Mezquita, stairs leading to and from the top of the tower are placed in the
middle of the platform area used for standing.  The minaret has a small
roof, and a railing is placed around the wide walkway to keep people from
falling.  Once used to call Cordoba's devoted Muslims to prayer, this tower
is now stationed by Christian archers and lookouts.

This large room has been hewn from the bedrock beneath the Mezquita and
is lit by several dimly glowing stones set in regular intervals into the
walls.  Thick steel chains are set into the floor in six places, seemingly
for holding prisoners.  Set before the chains is a large semi-circular table
with five chairs behind it.  Behind the table and chairs is a large
crucifix.  Three rows of heavy wooden benches rest opposite from the table,
and behind them a spiral stair winds to a trap door.

The Sewers of Cordoba~
These large stone tunnels were built long ago during the Roman expansion
into the Iberian lands.  Although no longer used by the majority of the
citizens of Cordoba, these sewers are still pits of human excrement,
garbage, and other unpleasant things which smell disgusting.  The sounds of
water and filth dripping from the walls can be heard all around you, and
their echos make it difficult to determine where sounds originate.  From
time to time you spot massive rats covered in a putrid slime crawl from
beneath debris and into cracks in the tunnel walls.  As you move around you
can't help but get a bit of the same slime that is on the rats on your own
feet.

Catacombs beneath Cordoba~
These catacombs were probably originally used by the Romans at one point
to bury their dead, but now they lie empty.  Signs of recent expansion are
evident by the coloring of some of the newer tunnels and the remenants of a
few mining tools.  A few places on the walls are streaked with small
rivulettes of water, and dripping can be heard echoing through the
catacombs.  From time to time you also think you hear the echoing of
footsteps, but you can not be sure, as the walls distort almost all sound. 
A large pipe set in the southern wall is fitted with a door that opens only
one way allowing someone to leave these tunnels, but allowing no one in.

#rKitchens of La Taberna Rojo#n~
These kitchens bustle with activity at almost all times of the day.  It
is staffed by a half dozen cooks and kitchen servants who hurriedly prepare
food for visiting gentry and even the occasional rawdy celebration of
knights or young nobles.  Large stoves line two of the walls with chimneys
diverting the smoke outside.  A couple of large shuttered windows are in
here to allow the cooks fresh air.

#rA room within La Taberna Rojo#n~
This room is quite large by inn lodgings standards.  The reputation for
extravagance is well earned, as these rooms are decorated with the finest
carpets, curtained windows, and furniture.  A large four-poster bed stands
against the far wall, near the window, and has a feather matress and a
pillow, as well as a thick blanket.  There is also a small table and three
chairs in the center of the room, and small fireplace to one side, an
armoire and a writing desk not far from that.  All rooms in this place are
also quite clean, being attended by servants nearly every day.

#yA Room of the Moondancer Inn#n~
Comfort seems to be the theme in this room with it large bed covered in a
wool blanket of rich forest green.  A small, dark wooden table sits under
the window with a few single matching chairs scooted up under it.  A
fireplace lies to the far northern side of the room with a comfortable
looking arm-chair placed before it.  A single large cabinet stands alone on
the final free wall opposite the door offering a place to store clothing and
blankets.

#yA Hallway#n~
An extensive hallway constricted by the doors that branch off to either
side every so many feet is detailed here in a chillingly dim light.  The
lumbered walls flicker an amber hue as the candles that cling to them
present an uncanny glow that bounces about the hallway and defies the
comforting nature presented by mostly every other aspect of the inn.  The
entrances into the rooms themselves that lead both north and south are large
wooden constructs of a stunning craft.  Each door baring the design of a
wolf howling to a moon far beyond their stand, etched in thick black streaks
that present a rather unsettling visage.

#yA Room of the Moondancer Inn#n~
Comfort seems to be the theme in this room with it large bed covered in a
wool blanket of rich forest green.  A small, dark wooden table sits under
the window with a few single matching chairs scooted up under it.  A
fireplace lies to the far northern side of the room with a comfortable
looking arm-chair placed before it.  A single large cabinet stands alone on
the final free wall opposite the door offering a place to store clothing and
blankets.

`bAn Unassuming Home`n~
The surprisingly strong oaken door of this house, fortified by several
metal bolts and a lock that is presented on the outside as well as the in,
leads into a rather average, if comfortable, room.  A small cot lies on the
hard earthen floor along the west side of the room, with a rather
warm-looking and well-used blanket.  There are various maintenance materials
for weapons sitting on the northern end of the room, inside an unused
fireplace, along with an empty wooden weapon rack that seems to be rather
worn and possibly second hand.  A second cot lies along these materials, the
same as the first, although not half as battered as the first.  There is a
chest at the foot of both cots, filled with various belongings, mostly
clothes and preserved foodstuffs.  There are some wooden chairs and a table
of similar make in the center of the room, and on the southern end a pair of
doors are built into the floor, apparently opening into a basement, the
doors to which seem to be just as strong as the one at the entrance, and
there is a lock on these doors.

`bThe Basement`n~
The first thing that is noticable upon entering what should be a dank,
cold cellar is the smell of rich, aged wood and scented candle smoke as one
descends a short flight of stairs along the northern wall to a well-packed
and dry earthen floor.  The room is actually quite spacious, with a small,
cloth-covered chair and accompanying wooden footstool resting against the
eastern wall, along with a small table.  The smell seems to hang here
perpetually, as evidenced by several burning candles surrounded by metal
webs, which are attached to the walls here.  Several large stacks of
candles, as well, as kept under another table and chairs set that also rests
in the center of the room, covered in various ink-written scripts and a map
of Cordoba, along with an inkwell and feather-pen.  Well-kept suits of light
armor line the walls, along with their respective maintenance materials. 
The entryway to the basement itself is even more heavily fortified than that
of the home, covered in bolts, latches, and locks to which no one man could
possibly have all the keys.  A bed rests against the southern wall here as
well, seeming to be of good quality.  A locked chest rests at the foot of
this bed, and on the wall next to the bed hangs a sword.  Also, a wooden
rack with three short spears rests against the head of the bed, seeming to
surround a would-be sleeper in weapons.  Just under the pillow, the hilt of
a dagger is occasionally visible.  There is a small bed at the very center
of the room, with a single, clean pillow and a pair of thick blankets upon
it.  Beneath it is a small, locked iron box with the initials "ALM" upon the
lid.

#wSome Gardens Before a Large House#e - #C(#wHoly Ground#e:#w 1#C)#n~
These gardens are surrounded on the north and west by tall stone walls
and a large gate is set into the northern wall.  To the south a large house
has recently been built.  The gardens are beautiful and well maintained. 
Pebbled paths lead through small clusters of various Iberian flowers, and
several fruit trees have also been planted.  To the east a squat, stone
stable.  A few stone benches offer respite from standing.

colorful Iberian carpets. Large bay windows offer an excellent view of the
gardens and the stables. A broad staircase leads up from here to the second
level of the house and a door leads to the south. A large open arch to the east
leads to a sitting room.

Plush chairs, a large couch and several tables of varied size furnish this room.
A series of paintings on the walls depict the crucifiction and rebirth of
Christ, and give life to the warm brown of the wooden paneled walls. The floor
is covered in a thick rug of Arabic manufacture and set into the eastern wall is
a massive fireplace crafted of grey fieldstone, with a hearth of black marble.
Several tall windows allow easy viewing of the gardens to the north. Large
arches in the west and south walls lead to the atrium and dining room.

#wA Spacious Dining Room#e - #C(#wHoly Ground#e:#w 1#C)#n~
The first thing most people notice about this room is the large chandelier
hanging from the ceiling. It is not crafted of glittering crystal as most prefer
but of dark iron. It is held together with at sharp angles with large bolts. It
has settings for nearly thirty large candles, and when lit casts stark shadows
about the room. Beneath the chandelier is a large table made of a very dark
wood. Eight large chairs are positioned around it, and it could easily acomadate
more if necessary. Windows set in the eastern wall offer views of a well groomed
lawn. A large arch in the north wall leads back into the sitting room, and there
is a door leading west.

This kitchen is obviously well stocked and well taken care of. A large oaken
table in the middle of the room offers a wonderful prep area and three wood
stoves give ample cooking space. Pantries line the west wall, and pots and pans
cover the rest of the availible area, save for the two windows in the southern
wall. Doors lead to the north and the west from here.

#wAtop the Grand Stair#e - #C(#wHoly Ground#e:#w 2#C)#n~
This area atop the stairway is decorated with implements of war. Hanging from
the walls are various swords, maces, axes and spears. Although they look
fearsome, to the trained eye they would obviously be of little use in combat.
From this vantage you can look down over a large balcony to the atrium. Aside
from the stairway leading down, short hallways lead to doors to the west, south
and east.

This bedroom is obviously shared by several people.  There are four bunk
beds in this room, each in some state of disarray, and there are also eight
chests of drawers.  The room is decorated very simply.  A single rug covers
the center of the floor with two tables atop it.  Eight wooden chairs are
also scattered about the large room.  Although the room looks lived in, it
does not appear overly messy.

This room is clearly the master suite.  A huge bed with dark fur blankets
is against the eastern wall, and hanging over it is a tapestry of the sun
rising behind a crucified Jesus.  The walls are paneled with a cherry wood,
and the floor is bare, revealing highly polished dark wood.  A large cabinet
and chest of drawers are against the northern wall, as well as a writing
desk with a large chair.  In the middle of the floor there are two wooden
chairs, a table and a small couch.  An curtained arch is set into the
southern wall.

chest of drawers.  No art adorns the walls, nor are rugs on the wooden
floor.  Although simple, the room does offer a comfortable place to rest.  A
large window set into the southern wall gives a spectacular view of Cordoba.

and a small desk.  Built into the southern wall there is a simple altar,
nothing more than a cross with a tapestry of the Virgin Mary behind it.  Its
simple elegance brightens the otherwise stuffy room.

This large town square is quite magnificent, there are four large pylons
on either corner of the market place, making it look like something out of
the Roman era.  There are four main shops in each corner while smaller shops
make up the rest inbetween.  In the far north-eastern corner is the
Blacksmith while in the southern-eastern corner is the local Tailor, the
south-western corner is made of a fine foods shop while the north-western
corner is an Apothecary.  Road lead off in all directions from here.

while a few private booths line the walls.  A large fireplace is located on
the northern wall of the Inn, a large hearth rug lies in front of the
fireplace while a few comfortable looking chairs sit around the fireplace
and the hearth rug.  A few fine tapstries have been placed on the wall, all
of which depicting something, one of them shows a massive, noble looking
silver wolf engulfed in silver light, while a slightly smaller greyish wolf
cowers in fear of the silver wolf.  A few of the other tapestries show
wolves howling at the moon and others in battles with eachother.

though for an unowned orchard, there doesn't seem to be much rotten fruit on
the ground, signifying to one that most fruit is picked by locals before it
falls to the ground.  There is a building located to the south which
provides shelter for anyone seeking it, while a forest path leads off to the
east.

eastern side of this clearing, it is surrounded by thick, luscious green
grass, whil flowers grow at random in the grass, wafting a sweet scent
throughout the large clearing.  Some of the thick canopy has grown outwards
from the forest, providing a primative shelter for any who come here, though
by the looks of the area, not many know of this picture-perfect haven.

from the small kitchen.  A bar is located on the eastern side of the room
and a small fireplace on the northern side of the room.  Tables and chairs
have been placed around the room for patrons to seat themselves.

#yA Room of the Moondancer Inn#n~
Comfort seems to be the theme in this room with it large bed covered in a
wool blanket of rich forest green.  A small, dark wooden table sits under
the window with a few single matching chairs scooted up under it.  A
fireplace lies to the far northern side of the room with a comfortable
looking arm-chair placed before it.  A single large cabinet stands alone on
the final free wall opposite the door offering a place to store clothing and
blankets.

Before the Inn of the Crescent Moon.~
A small glimmer of light on the horizon gradually grows larger as you
crest over the winding road.  You are met by the winking windows and
pleasant smells of an inn, placed along the right side of the road,
seemingly at the exact center between Cordoba and Seville.  It is a simple
building, a stocky, two level inn, with several iron-wrought windows and a
stable off to the side.  The simple wooden sign above the doorway depicts a
carving of the quarter moon phase, with the title "The Crescent Moon"
written elegantly below.  In the distance, a lonesome howl resounds through
the air, and you wonder if perhaps you should invest in a room for the
night.

The Innyard~
As you walk closer to the inn, you begin to pick out more details about
the building itself.  The sign, which seemed to only bear the name and the
emblem of the inn, has lighter scrawl markings on the bottom, which you
cannot read despite your best attempts.  The crabgrass spikes up between the
patches of lawn in front of the inn, and a few stray dandelions make up a
poor excuse for foliage.  Through the lightly smudged windows you can see
but a couple of patrons inside, and none of them appear to be making much of
a ruckus.  A set of cracked stone steps is the connection between the door
and the dirt path below.  The wind blows at you from the east, and the smell
tells you the stables must be close by.  Behind you, the open road calls for
you to continue your journey.

The Stables~
The warm smell of musk and hay welcomes you as you enter the Crescent
Moon's Stable.  There are several stalls around, some empty, some holding
the magnificent stallions belonging to the inn's patrons.  One larger stall
sits in the corner, presumably for mares birthing colts.  Though not
immaculate, the stableman has done a magnificent job of keeping the area
mostly dung free and accommodating to all of the guests' mounts.  A couple
stools lie scattered about, presumably for visitors who wish to groom the
horses.  Saddles and bridles hang on pegs against the far wall, and a black
horse stares at you from the leftmost stable, casually eating from a
feedbag.  Aside from the occasional whinny from the stable's occupants, the
area is mostly quiet, save for the clatter of pans coming from somewhere in
the back of the stable.

The Crescent Moon~
As you open the door, you are not met with the jovial carousing you would
expect, but rather a subdued murmuring as the patrons continue conversing,
mostly unaware of your entrance.  The warmth given off by the fireplace
gives you a homely feeling immediately, and the cheerful light of several
lamps helps stave off the shadows.  The room is large without being
grandiose, an all furniture is simple wood, giving it a very rustic feel. 
Metal tankards line one end of the bar, and varying bottles of unknown
liquor are stacked against the bar's back wall.  The tables are circular,
each surrounded by about three stools.  The far right corner holds a larger,
rectangular table, ready to house a party of eight or more.  The barkeep is
a younger man with tired eyes and rumpled hair, sporting a loose white shirt
with a green vest, and brown leather breeches.  Standing near him is the
only apparent barmaid available, a busty young lass with cotton pantaloons
and a blouse that leaves little to the imagination.  From the backroom a
small din emerges and the clamor of pots and pans reveals the location of
the kitchen.  A stairwell to your right leads to the upstairs room.

The Kitchen of of the Crescent~
A wave of heat and mild nausea pass over you as you enter the cook's
domain.  It is clear that the kitchen staff of Crescent Moon adhere to a
different set of standards than the rest of the inn.  There are pots and
plates strewn everywhere, some in varying states of cleanliness, others
simply caked with food from days or weeks past.  The grizzled remains of
some recently slaughtered animal sit on top of a growing heap of filth which
now overflows out of a wooden trash barrel.  All sixteen of the chef's
knives stand upright, the tips shoved into a wooden board located near the
stove, which is little more than an open fire with a lid.  The chef himself
shows signs of sampling his own works often, and greasy hair rolls out from
underneath a greying handkerchief tied around his head.  His apron carries
stains of blood, and varying plates of food sit waiting to be given to the
patrons.  Despite the horrid conditions, the food he produces looks
excellent, and your mouth waters in spite of the stench.

The Basement~
Underneath the inn is the holding grounds for all of the wine and spare
grain the innkeeper could possibly need.  The storeroom carries the same
level of elegance that the bar did, tidy in spite of itself.  The sacks of
wheat and barley sit neatly in a far corner, dry to the touch thanks to a
well maintained structure.  Several barrels of mead sit next to a homemade
wine rack, which is practically empty, save for a few dusty bottles.  A
larger sack of oats sits in far away from the other grains, presumably used
for auxiliary horse feed.  Two wooden stools sit at the base of the stairs,
as the innkeep and the barmaid would often escape down into the cool
basement during the harsh summer months.  Despite the quiet solitude, you
can sense there is something else down here, but it's not quite apparent
just what...

A hidden room.~
The wall behind the wine rack swings aside, revealing the well-disguised
meeting room for any Kindred guests.  Several chairs are set up around a
larger table in the center, and a lamp of perpetual light softly illuminates
the room with a cold glow.  Other than the lamp, however, there is nothing
that would tip off the unsuspecting guest who might wander in here by
accident.  The innkeep, paid very well by certain brethren, has taken care
to not touch anything that resides within, and not to mention it to anyone,
regardless of who should ask.  Some of the more paranoid have chosen to
sleep there, but otherwise the room is seemingly unused.  The option of
closing the wall is offered by an iron ring on the inside, allowing people
to be private without being sealed in.  The noise of the inn above has
vanished completely, and you are completely secure in knowing only those
around you could possibly know you are here.

A hallway~
The stairs bring you away from the bustle of the commonroom downstairs
and up into the dividing hallway where your room is hidden.  Several doors
line the hall on either side, and at the far end is a window looking out
onto the forest beyond.  A single table sits at the head of the stairs, and
an unlit candle sits upon it, waiting to be used.  A single painting of a
stern older gentleman looks down dissapprovingly at anyone who passes
beneath him.  You feel wary with his eyes upon you, and you dash quickly to
your room.

The room is a simple one indeed, sporting nothing more than the basics
needed for getting through the night.  A single bed occupies the center of
the room, covered in simple blankets with no pillow.  A chair sits in the
corner, sagging with age and disrepair.  A table stands next to it, though
it seems to have been used more for holding dust than any amount of food. 
The wooden walls are unpainted, and the window looking out onto the road is
small and smudged with dirt.  A mirror is hung adjacent to the bed, and a
nail sticks out from the wall, offering a sorry invitation to hang something
from it.  All and all, it seems you really got your money's worth.

The "Duke's Room"~
For those who have the gold to spend, the Duke's Room (called so because
no one but royalty would use it) holds much more lavish conditions.  The bed
is large and canopy style, with several blankets and two fluffed pillows.  A
large dresser sits underneath a gold-trimmed mirror, both of which look
stolen from some merchant's trade cart.  A large square table is surrounded
by three chairs and a stool, and on top of the table is a steel basin, ready
to be filled for whatever cleaning needs should occur.  A lovely red curtain
rims a rather large window, which catches the perfect view of the sky
outside.  The walls are done in brown, so at first it's hard to tell if
they've been painted at all.  As a finishing touch, a single portrait of a
lovely young woman in green sitting on a chair sits next to the mirror. 
Unfortunately, the thick grey dust tells you no one has had the money to
rent this in a long, long time.

The Innkeeper's Room.~
The bedroom of the innkeeper is a simple one, yet it has a certain
inviting atmosphere to it.  A single bed sits in the corner unkept and
unmade, obviously small enough for just the young man himself.  Next to it
is a dresser which bears a broken leg, yet is still level enough to hold
various small trinkets, including a flask of the innkeep's "private stock." 
A cracked mirror hangs ruefully above the dresser, and it catches the
reflection of a padded chair which sits at the foot of the bed.  The only
item which catches your eye is a small painting of an older couple and their
young son.  You can only assume that the picture is of the innkeeper and his
parents, yet the child in the portrait looks nothing like him.  You're not
really sure why you're in his room, and now you begin to question why he
comes in here either.

A common sleeping room.~
Rather than split the cost of several rooms, this room is available to
the less-enriched comradery, and it shows.  Nothing is within this room save
for several cots strewn about.  Devoid even of blankets, this is made for
hardy travelers who have no intention other than saving up energy for the
journey the next day.  The single window faces toward the east, ready to
catch the rising sun and help rouse any who might think of sleeping in.  A
cracked mirror hangs crooked on the wall as an afterthought, as if the
innkeeper suddenly realized it might be important to those who need to be
dressed in the morning.  The door to your right will lead you back into the
hallway and toward the rest of the inn.

This closet contains all the necessities to run your very own Catholic
mass.  Scores of candles, incense pyramids, communion wafers and bottles of

several robes for altar boys to don before the services.  The only light in

The basement of the Cathedral #e(TF Rating: 7)#n~
This basement is like nothing you would expect to find in a church.  The
room is about half the size of the main cathedral, and is filled with very
uncatholic instruments.  Various swords, spears, axes and the like are
mounted on weapon stands bolted securely to the stone and cement walls. 
Several cabinets are also pushed against the wall, and through the glass
doors you can see a wide array of firearms and crossbows.  Near the western
wall there are several beds and a great deal of medical equipment, as well
as a large bookshelf stuffed with tomes and volumes.  Several chairs, tables
and other pieces of furniture also decorate this room.  Most odd of the
furnishings in this room is a great steel cage with bars easily as thick as
a mans wrist.  The cage uses the bedrock the cathedral was built on as one
wall, and the metal bars surround the rest of the enclosure.  A massive
steel plate at least four inches thick is welded to the top of the bars
giving them added stability and keeping the top of the cage secure.

All around you small shrubs, flowers and other varied plants grow. 
Crushed stone paths weave through the beautiful scenery, giving it a
slightly labyrinthine feel.  Stone benches scattered throughout the garden
offer many comfortable places to enjoy the surroundings.  In the center of
the garden a massive statue of Saint Mary rises above the begonias and
tulips planted at her feet and reaches towards the sky.

A condominium community.~
The road here circles back on itself, making the dead end easier to
navigate.  In the middle of the loop a small park has been built.  A few
wooden benches, a swing set, a sand box and a wooden jungle gym furnish the
park.  Identical condos have been built to the west and north, and to the
east there is a small rectangular building and a large, in ground pool.  The
buildings the condos are in are newly constructed, sided in a light grey
vinyl and trimmed in a muted blue.  The rectangular building is not nearly
as large as the condos, but its color scheme is the same.  This entire
community reeks of the upper middle class.

This is the entrance hall to an upper-middle class condo building.  The
building is a split level job and stairways lead up and down from here. 
Recessed flouresant lights illuminate the warm blue tones of the walls and
the subtle green of the carpeting.  Four mail boxes are recessed within the
western wall.  They are labeled 1a 2a 3a and 4a.  Mounted on the ceiling in
one of the corners you notice a small security camera with a red light
blinking.  This room looks like it is cleaned at least daily as the tones on
the carpet have not been dulled in the least.

30 feet, it is easily large enough for a large number of people to
concurrantly enjoy it.  A wide cement patio surrounds the pool and expensive
lawn furniture offers respite from standing.  The lawn around the patio is
well tended and even the grass smells freshly cut.  An unremarkable building
with grey siding is to the south.  There are two large buildings to the
west, and a playground surrounded by a loop of road.

Looming up from the ground are the tall walls of the city of Cordoba. 
The city is so large that the walls wrap around so far they seem to
disappear into the horizon.  These are the large gates of the West Gate.  A
large metal portcullis spans the large gap in the walls and thick oak double
doors that stand over two stories high swing open into the city.  The gate
itself is wide enough for several carts to pass side by side.

This wide road is still paved at this point, having been built centuries
past by the Romans.  It shows signs of wear though, and up ahead becomes
mostly dirt with cobblestones being placed sporadically.  Widing along a few
yards away from the road is the wide Guadalquivir River.  North of here is a
large villa, and to the east are the walls of Cordoba.

to the last time you were able to just relax in the water, and cannot

yourself drift away...  But something convinces you to stay on your path and

A bridge over a small creek~
A large brook suddenly forks off the river and has driven directly across
your path.  To assist your traveling, a solid stone bridge has been made
over it, adorned in tiles and empty sockets that once held semi-precious
stones.  Opaque stone makes up most of the bridge, with mosaics of color on
each side, holding no real meaning other than to please the eye.  It arches
up and over, giving plenty of leeway for any who might want to seek shelter
beneath it in times of storm.  You marvel at the craftsmanship that's gone
into this bridge, and are almost sorry when you continue back along the
plain roadway.

A road along a river~
As you walk along the road, you continue to glance back at the water's
edge.  There is something serenely inviting about the water.  You think back
to the last time you were able to just relax in the water, and cannot
remember such a time.  How pleasing just to slip into the water and let
yourself drift away...  But something convinces you to stay on your path and
journey onward.  From time to time people pass by, but for the most part
your travels are solitary.  #oA trail leads west through some light woods
into the forest.  #n

Before the Gates of Seville~
The tall gates of Seville stand directly before the road here.  They loom
up, a combination of iron bars and a thick wooden door, the gates are wide
enough to allow several carts to pass side by side.  The gate opens up into
the great city of Seville to the south, while the road turns north and winds
off somewhere else.

Beneath the bridge~
Taking care not to get yourself wet, you waddle underneath the bridge,
hiding in the shadows of the underside.  The amount of room under the bridge
is actually rather spacious, and you see the ashes from where a campfire was
pitched by drifters previously.  Crabs scuttle near the waterfront, and you
are pleased to find the dirt to be dry near the top, perfect for taking a
short rest.  Here you can hide in wait for whatever means you so desire.  An
ideal place for an impromptu meeting.  When ready, you can return the same
way you came in and continue your journey back across the bridge.

#CTrancendenz#n Entrance~
Off the beaten path of the main street is a small cobblestone path,
leading through a white-stoned zen garden, accented with small gurgling
fountains.  Beyond this is the entrance to Trancendenz, a trendy nightclub
with an oriental feel.  The building itself is reminiscent of the shinto
temples of Japan, complete with a japanese gate atop the roof that aligns
exactly with the rise and fall of the moon.  The entrance is quite large for
a building of this size, nearly a full ten feet across, and warded by a
large heavy wooden door.  Guards, naturally adorned in charcoal suits, can
be seen ambling across the garden, obviously stopping anyone who isn't
formally invited to this elite locale

"#CThe Atrium#n"~
The soft tranquility receeds into a large atrium, accented by a large
glass window that displays the grandure of the night sky in motion.  Green
laser light wades in from the north, glowing upon the soft marble tile.  To
the east, a small stairway leads into a calmer sitting room, while an
adjacent staircase leads up into another chamber.  Pulsing rave music throbs
in from the north, and the motion of swaying bodies can be seen.  As always,
burly guards in fashionable suits stride about the area.

The massive pulse of rave music permeates this room, crushing all other
sounds under the heavy base.  A massive crowd of near-teenage adults seem to
throb along with it, nearly obscuring all view beyond this point.  Green
razor blades of laser-light trace along the crowd, giving off a little
ambient light for vision.

#YA Concrete Courtyard~
This concrete jungle is filled with dingy grey planters, each emcompassed
by withering foliage of many mundane breeds.  Obviously a child of an
earlier generation, this garden has seen better days, namely those from half
a century ago.  A delapidated wood door to the north leads to the interior
of a public housing project, the only obvious security measure taken being a
small bronze deadbolt.

Jester in a Cube~
A fine fast food establishment, marked by a round headed clown with a
yellow hat.  A sign on the window says open 24 hours, costumers for this
restaurant seems to be endless as pimpled filled faces come and go every
other moment, some stay to eat here others leave.  The dinning area is
filled with several booths, and a few tables and chairs.  The order counter
seems to be busy all the time, signs of breakfast combos, and new burgers
crowed the walls.  A small door to the east seems to lead to the bathrooms,
while the parking lot lies south.

A small concrete slab, can be considered bigger than this parking-lot. 
The cars seems to have been dumped into each space as there is barely room
for movement.  The cars ranges from new Honda civics, to old El Dorado's. 
Outside the restaurants, loitering teenagers can be found eating their meals
at all ours of the day, and night.

As the sun settles for its rest, a line begins to form outside this
building.  People standing in the lines seems heterogeneous, from all walks
of life but all dressed to have fun.  Women dressed in very revealing and
scandalous clothing, men flossed out in the finest style.  This is the
entrance of club RIDE, the hottest night club in all of San Francisco, maybe
even California.  Down below leads to the underground parking lot, while the
only entrance seems to be through one door.  One problem though The Rok.

Flashing lights, and subtle beats of many drums floods the room quickly. 
This is not the dance floor itself, rather the lobby, that leads to one of
three rooms.  People stick around out here and socialize with others, while
some proceeds quietly to one of the dance rooms.  The place looks packed, as
usual, never a dull moment at The Ride.  Straight ahead north is the hip hop
room, to the east is the Trance/ Techno room, and to the west is Spanish
rock.  , although there are stairs to the side leading up, but it seems to
be barred off.

and orders of customers.  To the eastern wall is a fully stocked bar.  To

in the far western wall seems to be always empty, a small placard marks it
as reserved.  The restaurant strangely has no windows, but a vent on the
ceiling constantly fills the room with fresh clean bay air.

this very dangerous area.  A large sign blaring vacancy, occupies the place

Several old, broken down cars are parked in the motel parking lot.  A few
people are gathered here around an individual selling things from the trunk
of his car.  Sirens blare through the air, frightening some of the
consumers, but they return to their shopping when the sirens die down.  Back
south is the motel, while a fire escape ladder drops to the floor, to allow
access to the second level.

Stairs~
The zenith of the stairs is in the same bad shape as the base.  Although
not a lot of people traffic the top floor, the upper level is still left in
the same bad shape as the bottom.  Although no bums sleep here, there is
still a faint smell diffused from below.

A hallway~
The hallway is very quiet, the sounds of the streets is distant from
here.  But the smell seems to be rampant, as the stench of human foulness
seems to diffuse through the wall.  To the east is the stairs, and the
hallway continues north.

Hallway~
A foul stench permeates the walls of this hallway.  Four dim lights,
illuminate the whole second level.  Strange noises can be heard from one of
the rooms, or it could be just the old motels frame shifting.  To the west
is Room 2A, while to the east is Room 2B, the hall way continues north and
south.

down vending machine, and ice dispenser is here for the guest of this motel.
The hallways continues north and south.

The Long hallway ends here, the stench a distant memory.  The hallway is

to the east is room 2D.

Fire Escape~
The fire escape is old, and rustic but seems very stable.  The sky spans
the horizon as it reveals the background that is San Francisco.  Two or
three people can be found here from time to time, smoking a cigarette, or
something that looks like one but definitely does not smell like it.  The
fire escape leads to the parking lot below.

Observation Room~
The Observation room of the rock, many people have seen the death, and
destruction of many criminals from this room.  They have seen the look of
horror in the dying faces of murderers and rapist.  And they have also seen
the unrelenting stares of remorseless criminals.  Ghost, spirits, and
apparitions have all been rumored to haunt this room.  To the north lies a
Large window with a door that leads to the Electric chair, and to the south
a similar configuration but leads to the Gas Chamber.  To the west is a
small chapel.

The Chapel~
The quiet solitude, of this dark empty chapel cuts through like the
poorly fashioned shanks found in this place.  Although the chapel has been
empty for many years, a strange aura surrounds the place, like a think
silken sheet.  Thick cobwebs, and so many layers of dust now lay claim to
the altar, and pews of this chapel.  Outside the chapel is the observation
room.

#oThe Eastern Gate of Sevilla#n~
Sevilla's eastern gate is a massive combination of both a wooden gate and
a heavy iron portcullis that bridge the gap in the city's walls.  On either
sides of the gates, on both the ground, and atop the city walls, are guard
houses and towers.  Although left open even during the night this gate is
constantly manned by soldiers.

#oBefore the East Gate of Sevilla#n~
The streets of Sevilla are quite narrow, although here it widens
noticeable, allowing a few carts to pass side by side comfortably.  Tall
buildings rise up on both sides of the road, and are mostly homes to the
many citizens of this great city.  The eastern gate of Sevilla, one of its
main entrances, is just a little further down the street to the east, so
there is almost always activity around here.

The streets of Sevilla are quite narrow, allowing for only the width of

from the ambient light of candles in the windows of homes, and also the
lamps placed on poles above the roads to give some illumination for those
citizens who are out after dark.

#oNearing the Jewish Quarter of Sevilla#n~
This is an entrance to the Juderia, the Jewish Quarter.  Loosely
seperated from the rest of the city's populace the Jews were given their own
section of the city and get along quite while with the Moorish rulers.  The
street seems to narrow even more as it grows closer to the Juderia, though
there is still a great deal of traffic.  From the small part of the Juderia
that can be seen, it appears quite a clean area.

#oThe Jewish Quarter#n~
In the Jewish Quarter of Seville the street becomes barely wide enough
for a cart to pass in some places, and winds about like a lazy river. 
Clothes hang out to dry from lines stretched across second and third floor
windows, and despite the close quarters, everything is clean and some small
houses even boast flowers planted out in front.  Several small trees also
spring up from patches of uncovered earth, and some light is cast upon the
streets by the soft glow of the flames contained in lamp-posts that line the
roads.

#oCalle de las Sierpas#n~
The Calle de las Sierpas, street of the snakes, in Castillian, winds
through much of Seville, crossing several other major areas.  Keeping the
name of the street that is was given by the previous Christian rulers, the
Moors have expanded the Calle de las Sierpas in their several hundred years
long domain over the city.  It is now a network of streets, all windy as its
original namesake.  Many of the markets and other commerce centers are
located along and around the Calle de las Sierpas, and the overtly Moorish
styled buildings are as clean in this part of Sevilla as they are anywhere
else.

#oMarket Square of Sevilla#n~
This is Sevilla's marketplace.  The normally narrow, winding streets
widen here so that many merchants can have the room to set up stalls.  Used
by day to hold Sevilla's large markets, merchants come from far and wide to
have a chance to hawk their wares in this large metropolis.  Many of the
buildings around here are used by the city's craftsmen and guilds, and there
are still many lights on and people going about their business or just
having fun well into the late evening and occasionally the night.  Enormous
archways and pillars stand all about the marketplace, giving the square an
awe-inspiring quality.

#oMarket Square of Sevilla#n~
This is Sevilla's marketplace.  The normally narrow, winding streets
widen here so that many merchants can have the room to set up stalls.  Used
by day to hold Sevilla's large markets, merchants come from far and wide to
have a chance to hawk their wares in this large metropolis.  Many of the
buildings around here are used by the city's craftsmen and guilds, and there
are still many lights on and people going about their business or just
having fun well into the late evening and occasionally the night.  Enormous
archways and pillars stand all about the marketplace, giving the square an
awe-inspiring quality.

#oCalle de las Sierpas#n~
The Calle de las Sierpas, street of the snakes, in Castillian, winds
through much of Seville, crossing several other major areas.  Keeping the
name of the street that is was given by the previous Christian rulers, the
Moors have expanded the Calle de las Sierpas in their several hundred years
long domain over the city.  It is now a network of streets, all windy as its
original namesake.  Many of the markets and other commerce centers are
located along and around the Calle de las Sierpas, and the overtly Moorish
styled buildings are as clean in this part of Sevilla as they are anywhere
else.

#oThe winding northern streets of Sevilla#n~
The streets of Sevilla are quite narrow, allowing for only the width of
two carts to pass by comfortably.  Tall buildings rise up on both sides of
the road, blocking out much sunlight during the day and a large portion of
the moonlight during the night.  Much of the visibility in the streets comes
from the ambient light of candles in the windows of homes, and also the
lamps placed on poles above the roads to give some illumination for those
citizens who are out after dark.  The homes in this area of the city appear
quite sumptuous, and the streets are remarkably devoid of the signs of
poverty.

These narrow meandering roads make up the Barrio de Santa Cruz, a vast
neighborhood that makes up the largest area of Sevilla, and is home to the
largest and most diverse population of the city.  Many of the smaller shop
keepers and merchants of Sevilla make the Barrio de Santa Cruz their
location of choice.  The streets are remarkably clean, and light filters
down the dark streets from the shuttered windows of dwellings.  Unlike many
other cities in Europe, the gutters are devoid of human waste and refuse,
which only adds to the beauty and sophistication of the Moorish architecture
and well cared for roads.

Rising up from this network of streets is a large mosque.  Looking quite
new from the richness of the dome at its apex and the tile work of the
mosaic around the road leading up to the mosque, this place of worship must
be one of the most extravagent of the hundreds of mosques located around
Seville.  Many of the markets and other commerce centers are located along
and around the Calle de las Sierpas, which can be found north of here, and
the overtly Moorish styled buildings are as clean in this part of Sevilla as
they are anywhere else.

The streets of Sevilla are usually quite narrow, allowing for only the
width of two carts to pass by comfortably, yet here they widen quite a lot. 
The slightly worn paving and larger gutters in these streets speak of the
increased traffic they recieve due to such close proximity to the southern
city gates.  The buildings in this portion of the city are a bit smaller. 
Mostly storefronts and homes that take up sections of property, they are

and the sounds of people talking.  Dominating the street is the Inn of the
Faithful, a reststop for travellers making their way through Sevilla. 
Although alcohol is not served in keeping with the Muslim tradition of the
city, many people visit the gathering place for the company, the fare or
just a soft bed.  To the south lies the large southern gate of Sevilla,
while the streets continue to the west and east.

Even during the night, light floods into the Inn of the Faithful's main
room, due to scattered torches hanging from the walls.  Fluted columns are
spaced around the room to support the second floor of the inn.  Travelers
from all walks of life gather around all the tables to trade stories,
business and most of all, food and drink.  The center of the room opens up
towards the sky, allowing fresh air to flow into the inn.  Hand detailed,
wooden railings surround the opening to the second floor walkway.  Moorish
style arches open up in all the doorways leading to various other rooms of
the inn.  A staircase leads to the second floor for the customers seeking
rooms at the inn.  The west leads to the kitchens, a hanging curtain made of
various colored beads closes the area off to the inn's visiting patrons.

buildings rise up on both sides of the road, and are mostly homes to the
many citizens of this great city.  The southern gate of Sevilla, one of the
city's main entrances, is just a little further down the street to the
south, so there is almost always activity around here.

Sevilla's southern gate is a massive combination of both a wooden gate
and a heavy iron portcullis that bridge the gap in the city's walls.  On
either sides of the gates, on both the ground, and atop the city walls, are
guard houses and towers.  Although left open even during the night this gate
is constantly manned by soldiers.

way to and from the wharfs that serve as a major hub of activity and
commerce in the city.

The gentle lapping of the tributary of the Guadalquivir can be heard

tied up to the docks, most likely used by merchants and for fishing.  The
southern wharfs serve as a major hub of activity and trade for Sevilla,
controlling the flow of goods out on to the major river of southern Iberia. 
During the day this area is alive with trade, the river full of crafts, but
at night the docks by the black water calm down, only a few wandering people
left outside.

and south the streets continue, east leads towards El Barrio de Santa Cruz
and the bridge spans the wide river to the west.

draws forth the university's visitors and is lined with rows of orange trees
and other small fragrent plants.  As the street continues east and west it
seems as if all are drawn to the university's grand architecture and pass by
it slowly.

the Moorish architecture and well cared for roads.

The streets of Sevilla are quite narrow, allowing for only the width of
two carts to pass by comfortably.  Tall buildings rise up on both sides of
the road, blocking out much sunlight during the day and a large portion of
the moonlight during the night.  Much of the visibility in the streets comes
from the ambient light of candles in the windows of homes, and also the
lamps placed on poles above the roads to give some illumination for those
citizens who are out after dark.  The homes in this area of the city appear
quite sumptuous, and the streets are remarkably devoid of the signs of
poverty.

#oWithin northern Sevilla#n~
The streets of Sevilla are quite narrow, allowing for only the width of
two carts to pass by comfortably.  The buildings in this portion of the city
are a bit smaller.  Mostly storefronts and homes that take up sections of
property, they are crafted in the traditional Moorish style of arches and
open spaces.  The streets keep winding off south and north.

#oNear the Northern Gate#n~
The streets of Sevilla are quite narrow, although here it widens
noticeable, allowing a few carts to pass side by side comfortably.  Tall
buildings rise up on both sides of the road, and are mostly homes to the
many citizens of this great city.  The northern gate of Sevilla, one of its
main entrances, is just a little further down the street to the north, so
there is almost always activity around here.

#oSevilla's North Gate#n~
Sevilla's northern gate is a massive combination of both a wooden gate
and a heavy iron portcullis that bridge the gap in the city's walls.  On
either sides of the gates, on both the ground, and atop the city walls, are
guard houses and towers.  Although left open even during the night this gate
is constantly manned by soldiers.

#oEl Barrio de Santa Cruz#n~
These narrow meandering roads make up the Barrio de Santa Cruz, a vast
neighborhood that makes up the largest area of Sevilla, and is home to the
largest and most diverse population of the city.  Many of the smaller shop
keepers and merchants of Sevilla make the Barrio de Santa Cruz their
location of choice.  The streets are remarkably clean, and light filters
down the dark streets from the shuttered windows of dwellings.  Unlike many
other cities in Europe, the gutters are devoid of human waste and refuse,
which only adds to the beauty and sophistication of the Moorish architecture
and well cared for roads.

#oThe Jewish Quarter#n~
In the Jewish Quarter of Seville the street becomes barely wide enough
for a cart to pass in some places, and winds about like a lazy river. 
Clothes hang out to dry from lines stretched across second and third floor
windows, and despite the close quarters, everything is clean and some small
houses even boast flowers planted out in front.  Several small trees also
spring up from patches of uncovered earth, and some light is cast upon the
streets by the soft glow of the flames contained in lamp-posts that line the
roads.

#oEntering the Jewish Quarter of Sevilla#n~
This is the entrance to the Juderia, the Jewish Quarter.  Loosely
seperated from the rest of the city's populace the Jews were given their own
section of the city and get along quite while with the Moorish rulers.  The
street seems to narrow even more as it grows closer to the Juderia, though
there is still a great deal of traffic.  From the small part of the Juderia
that can be seen, it appears quite a clean area.

The gentle lapping of the tributary of the tributary that feeds the

wharfs.  Several boats are tied up to the docks, most likely used by
merchants and fishermen.  The Triana wharfs serve as a major hub of activity
and trade for Sevilla, supplying the flow of goods out to the major river of
southern Iberia.  During the day this area is alive with trade, the river
full of crafts, but at night the docks by the black water calm down, only a
few people left wandering out of doors.

Passing through the beaded curtain, a small hallway spreads stretches
out.  The sounds of the kitchen staff can be heard working throughout the
day and all of the night.  This part of the inn isn't as lavishly decorated
as the main room, but the architecture is still the same.  The kitchen opens
up to the south as the hallway continues to the west, towards the cellars.

At the end of the hallway, a set of stairs leads spiraling down into the

unlit ones can be seen staggered down the walk, awaiting to be lit in
passing.  The cooler temperature from the cellar seems to light blow up the
stairway, giving anyone passing a taste of the coolness down below.

Stacks upon stacks of wine and ale casks are situated neatly upon the
south wall.  The theme of torches placed around the area is still present
down here, yet never burning unless the workers need them.  A few degrees
cooler than the upstairs area, the cellar seems a perfect storage area for
all the wine and other stocks that the inn might have.

hangs sits within its holder.  Every other torch is lit, allowing only a

This room is laid out in a very ordinary style.  A simple desk, a wooden
washbasin with fresh water and a small closet are the only other furnishings
other than the bed.  The bed looks comfortable enough, though it isn't the
fanciest of creations.  A single lantern sits in the window frame, which
opens up into the night.

Though this room is a step above the standardized sleeping rooms of the
inn, it is still not the most lavish rooms.  A large comfortable looking,
double sized bed draws people to it just by its looks alone.  The oval
shaped window is set so one could open it in two parts if desired, looking
out upon the streets below.  Separate washbasins, handmade from ceramics,
await weary travelers who wish to freshen up before sleep or venturing back
down to the main room of the inn.

#RA Room within the Inn#n~
Upon entertaining this room, it is easy to notice it is the most
luxurious room within the inn.  Saved generally for special occasions or for
elite travelers, this room is tended to by the inn workers with precise
care.  A massive four poster canopy bed sits directly centered in the room. 
Surrounding it, washbasins of ivory, full of freshly poured water.  Oval
shaped glass oil lanterns brighten the room, as three separate windows allow
light to shine in when the drapes are opened.  The drapes, bed linens and
rugs all look as if the fabrics have been imported from far off places, just
to decorate this room.

#RThe Innkeeper's Room#n~
This room is quite smaller than the others upon this floor.  Many of the
furnishings are present, just like the lower grade rooms of the inn.  A
small journal and the ledgers, entitled "Inn of the Faithful" are scattered
about upon the desk.  It seems the innkeeper isn't worried with special
treatment and is more concerned with making sure his customers are happy.

#eOutside #rClub 13#n~
A long chain of people stand out in the San Francisco night waiting to
enter the infamous Club 13.  Known to be a center of Industrial Rock, and
Techno the mix of people outside the club is ecclectic, varying from Goths,
Hard Rockers, Playboys, Ravers, to Kandy Kids.  The outside of Club 13 looks
like an abandoned church and could pass off as one if not for the long line
of people, and the sound of thumping music from inside it.  Two large
bouncers stand infront of the portals, dressed uniformly in black shirts,
black cargo pants, black combat boots and sunglasses.

#eEntrance to #rClub 13#n~
Inside Club 13 the sound of music shatters the air.  As the latest
Industrial Rock band, or techno DJ spins at what used to be the altar, but
now is the performing stage.  Looking further to the north is a sea of
bodies writhing to the pulsating beat of the music.  Above a catwalk can be
seen with security guards looking down on the dancers.

walking over it.  The lights from the opposite side are a little bright
here.

#eDance Floor of #rClub 13#n~
The music's pulse can be felt on the dance floor by the slight shuttering
of pounding feet.  A sea of humans extends towards the raised dias which is
now a stage.  Above are frescos of angels battling demons.  On the ground
are small places where the pews of the church were once secured to the
ground.  Lights of various colors shine down on the crowd, flashing and
changing to the beat of music.  The roar of music and people previals making
most conversation hardly audible.

There's a large door leading into the lounge with a bouncer standing next to
it.  Above the catwalk can be seen patrolled by men.  A few of the lights
seem to blare down here, making it so that the eople on the opposite catwalk
can't be seen that well.

#eCenter of the Dance Floor#n~
Here at the center of the dance floor is where the crowd is the thickest.
The heat eminating from hundreds of bodies makes it seem like a desert.  The
lights blare down here and the pulse of music shutters through the area. 
People writhe, twist and sway to the music and the music roars out above the
roar of the crowd.  Above is a large dome of the Cathedral, just beneath is
seems to be a very fine wire for catching glass incase anything was to
shatter through.

Here at the side of the dance floor the crowd thins out just slightly,
except for the line waiting to get into the VIP Lounge of Club 13.  The
large doors to the VIP lounge look truely impressive and are, of course,
roped off.  Standing infront of the rope and doors are two large men dressed
uniformly in black wearing headsets also.

Mostly large speakers and light fixtures dominate this area of the dance
floor the beats and the sounds of the music pulsating out.  To the north is
a stainless steel door with a small pad next to it.

#eDance Floor infront of the Altar#n~
Here infront of the altar is where the music is the loudest.  The altar
stands raised about 4 feet above the ground, and all that remains is the
raised dais itself.  The altar has been moved off to one side and is now
used as a set up for the turn tables.  The podium has also been ripped out
and placed to one side.  Behind the raised dais are speakers and lights. 
Extending from the dias is a small catwalk for the singer or whomever to go
out slightly into the crowd.  There is almost nothing between the crowd and
the proformer besides a few large muscular body guards.

The Bar of Club 13 is very stylish.  The lighting here has dimmed from
the itense lights of the the dance floor.  Also the temperature here is
somewhat cooler.  A large bar dominated the eastern wall, and a variety of
drinks are there, ranging from water to the hardest of alcoholic beverages. 
The bar is tended by a few good looking individuals and tables have been set
up around the room.  Also a few boths are off on the sides and corners of
the room.

The Lounge~
The Lounge of Club 13 is simply hedonistic like.  The music lightly
thumps through the sound proof walls, letting just the beat come through. 
However a small speaker system allows the music to lightly flow into the
lounge.  Couches and chairs are placed around the room and the lighting is
dark in here.  Off to one side is a small hallway where the bathrooms are.

money wise.  Soundproof walls help drown out the music and a large vaulted
ceiling above gives the room a small taste of class.  To the north are
another pair of doors that lead into the actual VIP room.  Torchs line the
way to the doors, and the room is made out of bare stone.

#eV.I.P. Room#n~
The VIP lounge of Club 13 can be mostly summed up in one word:
Hedonistic.  Sound proof walls help drown out most of the music although it
can still be faintly heard.  The walls are made out of red plush velvet, and
along the walls are large red velvet couches.  A small bar sits off to one
side, and scantly clad waitresses move about serving drinks.  Also to the
north are another set of doors.  However, barring entrance are two men
dressed in black, and a video camera watching the door.  The men wear dark
sunglasses and dressed in black, except not uniformely wearing the same
clothes.  However they both wear long black overcoats

#eSpecial Access V.I.P.#n~
The true nature behind Club 13 shows here as Cainites sit off to one side
with their mortal prey, some playing with them while others simply drink
their blood.  This room seems filled with Cainites almost some flaunting
what they are openely.  Off to one side a Tzimisce does body alterations to
a mortal, or kindred.  The room is dimly lit and to the north is a large
symbol in blood red, that can easily be defined as the symbol of the Sabbat
to any Cainite that knows his or her stuff.

#eThe Altar#n~
The raised performing dais that was once the altar is now the center
stage.  Which ever band here has free view over the entire dance floor, a
sea of writing moving human and perhaps, unhuman bodies.  The whole
ex-Cathedral lays out infront and behind where a door that says "exit" in
dark red letters above it, and on the door itself says "backstage."  The
altar has been moved back and transformed into a pair of turn tables and the
pulpit lays off to one side.  The large crucifix and organs have been ripped
out it seems.  A long, narrow catwalk extends into the crowd for performers
to move out onto, be it the singer or guitarist.

mirror stands off to one side of the room which allows for final
preperations, and a part of the area is closed off by a screen for changing.
However, all the wiring seems to be underneath the ground, or just cleverly
hidden.  A small door is at the back of the room

The Moselium that stands here is a testiment to the wishes of a probably
influential family to have their dead buried.  The large Moselium is about
the size of a small hosue and made entirely out of grey stone.  Small angels
perch above the entrance, hands pressed together in pray, faces sad with
tears in remorse.  A small frame of stone for the doorway stands behind the
large pillars but sadly enough is blocked off by a large thick stone slab. 
Two stone lions sit at each side of the doorway, their stances suggesting a
warning.

#eA Narrow Hallway#n~
To the west is a small metal door that has been pad locked, the hallway
itself is very narrow enough to fit two people through it.  Up on the
ceiling is a small metal hemisphere that looks like a psuedo mirror.  This
hallway is devoid of decoration, just the humming flourescent lights and the
white washed walls.

At the back of the meat locker there seems to be another, smaller door
that is also made of metal.  Towards the back there are more slabs of meats
hanging from the hooks, and a small pathway has been laid out between the
crates and boxes.  Up near the ceiling is a large fan that makes a soft
whhiring sound as it spins.  Floating 3 inchs above the ground is a slight
mist from the cold of the freezer.

small layer of frost inside and the ground is slightly slippery.  A few meat
hooks however have no slabs of meat on them and the hooks seem wickedly
sharp.  Floating 3 inchs above the ground is a slight mist from the cold of

the tunnel to filter out any larger objects that may float down and out into
the harbour in the case of a flood or downpour.  Through the grill, the

The pipes that lined the wall further back in the tunnel now leak steam,
making this section of the tunnel quite warm, and also hard to see in.  The
water is a little more shallow here due to the tunnel widening slightly,
though it still does not change the stench of it.  The tunnel continues
northward

Main floor of the #cSiren's Din#n~
The main floor of the Siren's Din is very busy.  Several of tables have
been set up all around this earth tone setting.  The decoration is post
modern industralish with a splash of abstract.  To the east is a small stage
for a band, or poet or perhaps even an actor or a troupe of actors.  Most of
the tables are small, and sit two people while the others are larger and can
seat more people.  The lighting is pretty dim here, and soft music pours
through speakers stationed around the room.
